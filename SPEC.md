# Lace - Your lightweight agentic coding environment

## Core Architecture

### Orchestrator-Driven Agent System
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Primary agent that analyzes tasks and chooses appropriate models/agents
- **Specialized Subagents**: Focused workers assigned specific models and roles by orchestrator
- **Model Selection**: Calling agent decides which model to use based on task complexity
- **Memory Agents**: Previous generation agents kept alive as queryable memory oracles

### Agent Roles & Model Assignment
- **Planning**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` or `o3-mini` for complex task breakdown
- **Execution**: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` for fast, straightforward tasks  
- **Reasoning**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` for deep analysis and debugging
- **Memory**: Previous generation agents for historical context queries

### Multi-Generational Memory System
- **Active Context**: Current conversation with primary agent (monitored for capacity)
- **Memory Agents**: Previous agent generations available for detailed historical queries
- **Conversation Database**: Persistent storage of full conversation history
- **Context Handoff**: At 20% remaining capacity, spawn new primary agent with compressed context

### Essential Tools (MVP)
1. **Shell execution** - Run system commands
2. **File operations** - Read/write/edit files with atomic multi-file support
3. **JavaScript evaluation** - Computational capabilities without file I/O overhead
4. **Conversation persistence** - Store and query all interactions
5. **Task tracking** - Persistent todo lists and project state
6. **Basic text search** - Find content across files

### Context Management
- **Tool Output Summarization**: Subagents return insights, not raw output
- **Relevance Filtering**: Keep only contextually important information in working memory
- **Proactive Management**: Monitor and manage context continuously, not reactively
- **Seamless Handoff**: New agent instances inherit compressed state without losing access to detail

### Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (ES modules)
- **Database**: SQLite for conversation persistence
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js for command parsing
- **JavaScript Sandbox**: vm2 for safe evaluation
- **Context Limits**: Pulled from model API, not hardcoded

## Key Principles
- **Context pollution prevention**: Delegate tool execution to avoid filling main thread with outputs
- **Persistent memory**: Never forget user interactions or project context
- **Simple delegation**: Subagents do work and die, no complex inter-agent communication
- **Computational agent**: JavaScript evaluation makes agent computational, not just conversational

## MVP Goals
- Interactive console interface
- Multi-generational agent handoff working
- Persistent conversation storage
- Basic tool ecosystem functional
- Demonstration of self-contained task completion with memory retention

## Current Status

### Terminal UI Migration (React + Ink)
**‚úÖ Step 1 Complete**: Basic Ink App Setup with TypeScript
- Ink 6.0.0 + React 19 + TypeScript configuration
- tsx for JSX compilation and development
- Jest testing framework with ESM support
- Basic "Hello Lace" app with process lifecycle

**‚úÖ Step 2 Complete**: Basic Layout Structure  
- 3-component layout: ConversationView, StatusBar, InputBar
- Full-window terminal UI with no outer frame
- StatusBar: App name, status indicator, navigation hints with border styling
- ConversationView: Flexible content area with placeholder content
- InputBar: Cyan prompt with dim placeholder text
- Comprehensive functional tests (21 tests) verifying component behavior

**‚úÖ Step 3 Complete**: Basic Message Display
- Message component with user/assistant conversation history
- User messages: cyan "> " prefix, Assistant messages: green "ü§ñ " prefix
- Multi-line content support including code blocks
- Mock conversation data displaying properly formatted messages
- Comprehensive tests (27 total) verifying message rendering and layout
- 10-second demo timeout for manual testing

**‚è≥ Step 4 Pending**: Keyboard Navigation Mode
- Enter/exit navigation mode to scroll through conversation
- j/k keys for scroll up/down, Escape to exit
- Visual indicator of current mode and cursor position
