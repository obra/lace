## Project Notes

The reviewer found some good issues:

1. Race condition in ReleaseNotesProvider - should use AbortController instead of cancelled flag
2. Test mock mismatch - tests still mock the old generated file path but we're now importing from @/app/release-notes
3. Missing JSDoc comments on public functions
4. Need to document the update process

These are all valid points. The test mock issue is particularly important - the tests are mocking the wrong file path.

Also need to rebase on origin/main before merging.

Let me fix these issues systematically.
