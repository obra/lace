## Project Notes

Jesse is suggesting using a hash of the content instead of parsing a version number. This is actually brilliant because:

1. Keep the simplicity of having the markdown file in the web package
2. No manual version management needed
3. Calculate hash at runtime from the imported content
4. Any content change automatically triggers new version
5. No build scripts needed
6. No generated files
7. Easy to test

This combines the automation of the SHA approach with the simplicity of having everything in one package.

Structure would be:
- packages/web/app/release-notes.md (simple markdown file)
- Import as string with Vite
- Calculate hash at runtime in JavaScript
- Compare against user settings

Much cleaner and simpler!
