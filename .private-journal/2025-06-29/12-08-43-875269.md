ANALYZING TIMELINE FOCUS ISOLATION ISSUE

Based on my examination of the code, I think I understand the problem:

**The Problem:**
When a user enters a delegate timeline (by pressing Return on a delegate tool execution), both the main timeline (in ConversationDisplay) and the embedded delegate timeline (inside DelegateToolRenderer) are responding to arrow keys simultaneously.

**Current Architecture:**
1. ConversationDisplay renders a TimelineDisplay with main timeline
2. TimelineDisplay wraps content in TimelineViewport 
3. TimelineViewport uses `useLaceFocus(FocusRegions.timeline)` and `useInput(..., { isActive: isFocused })`
4. DelegateToolRenderer also renders a TimelineDisplay for the delegate thread
5. The delegate TimelineDisplay also wraps in TimelineViewport with same focus ID pattern

**The Issue:**
Both TimelineViewport instances (main and delegate) are using the same focus region type (`FocusRegions.timeline`), so when one gets focus, both think they should be active. The `{ isActive: isFocused }` should prevent this, but it seems both are getting `isFocused: true`.

**Key Lines:**
- TimelineViewport.tsx line 39: `useLaceFocus(FocusRegions.timeline, { autoFocus: false })`
- TimelineViewport.tsx line 98: `{ isActive: isFocused }`
- DelegateToolRenderer.tsx line 294: renders another `<TimelineDisplay timeline={timeline} />`

The delegate timeline should be using a different focus region or the main timeline should check if a delegate has focus before responding to keys.
