TIMELINE FOCUS ISOLATION ISSUE - RESOLVED

**Problem Summary:**
When a user pressed arrow keys in a focused delegate timeline, BOTH the main timeline AND the delegate timeline were scrolling/responding simultaneously. Only the focused timeline should respond.

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Both main and delegate timelines used the same focus region ID (`FocusRegions.timeline`)
- TimelineViewport uses `useLaceFocus(FocusRegions.timeline)` and `useInput(..., { isActive: isFocused })`
- Since both timelines used the same focus region, both thought they were focused when either was active
- This caused keyboard events to be handled by multiple timeline instances

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Modified TimelineViewport** to accept optional `focusRegion?: string` prop
2. **Modified TimelineDisplay** to pass through `focusRegion?: string` prop
3. **Modified DelegateToolRenderer** to pass delegate-specific focus region: `FocusRegions.delegate(delegateThreadId)`
4. **Main timeline** continues using default `FocusRegions.timeline`
5. **Delegate timelines** now use unique focus regions like `delegate-thread-123`

**Files Changed:**
- `TimelineViewport.tsx` - added focusRegion prop, use it in useLaceFocus
- `TimelineDisplay.tsx` - added focusRegion prop, pass to TimelineViewport  
- `DelegateToolRenderer.tsx` - pass delegate focus region to embedded TimelineDisplay

**Testing:**
- All existing tests pass
- Created new test `timeline-focus-isolation.test.tsx` to verify focus isolation
- Test verifies different focus regions are used and only one timeline can be focused at a time

**Verification:**
Each timeline now uses a distinct focus region:
- Main timeline: `timeline`
- Delegate timeline: `delegate-${delegateThreadId}` (e.g., `delegate-thread-123`)

This ensures keyboard events only affect the currently focused timeline.
