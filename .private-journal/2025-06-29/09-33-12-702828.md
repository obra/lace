## Project Notes

Timeline Entry Focus Implementation completed successfully:

**What was implemented:**
- FocusLifecycleWrapper: Generic focus management component that replaces modal-specific logic
- Timeline focus detection: Type-safe utilities to identify focusable timeline items (delegate tool calls)
- Return key handling: TimelineDisplay now detects Return key and triggers focus entry on focusable items
- Ref forwarding system: Complex chain from display → viewport → content → item → tool renderer
- Visual focus indicators: Yellow highlighting and "ESC to exit" vs gray selection hints
- Keyboard interaction: ESC exits focus, full interactivity when focused

**Architecture decisions:**
- Used renderWhenInactive=true for timeline items (always visible) vs false for modals (hide when closed)
- Focused items get yellow borders/text, selected items get gray hints with navigation instructions
- Only delegate tool executions with valid thread data are focusable
- Focus system builds on existing Lace focus regions and stack management

**Testing:**
- 31 tests for focus detection utilities
- 17 tests for FocusLifecycleWrapper behavior
- All existing modal and timeline tests continue to pass
- Mock updates required for new FocusLifecycleWrapper export

**Files modified:**
- Added: FocusLifecycleWrapper, timeline-item-focus utils + tests
- Modified: ModalWrapper (refactored), TimelineDisplay (Return key), TimelineContent (refs), TimelineItem (forwardRef), DelegateToolRenderer (focus lifecycle), CollapsibleBox/TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox (visual states)

**Known issues:**
- Warning about forwardRef in TimelineContent tests (non-breaking)
- Currently only delegate tools are focusable (by design, extensible for future tools)

Implementation follows the plan exactly and provides clean foundation for making other timeline items focusable in the future.
