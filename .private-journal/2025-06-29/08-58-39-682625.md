## Project Notes

Examining focus and keyboard patterns in Lace codebase to understand component entry mechanics:

## Current Focus Architecture

**Focus Stack System:**
- Uses `useLaceFocus(id)` hook - combines Ink's `useFocus` with hierarchical focus stack
- Components get `isFocused` (both Ink-focused AND at top of stack) and `takeFocus()` method
- ModalWrapper automatically pushes/pops focus when `isOpen` changes
- FocusRegions provides namespaced IDs like `FocusRegions.timeline`, `FocusRegions.modal('approval')`

**Timeline Navigation:**
- TimelineViewport handles keyboard: up/down navigate, left/right/return forwarded to parent via `onItemInteraction`
- TimelineDisplay receives item interactions and handles left=collapse, right=expand
- Return key is currently forwarded but not handled - just passed through the chain
- No concept of "entering" vs "selecting" - timeline items are either selected (cursor on) or not

**Tool Approval Modal Example:**
- Uses ModalWrapper with `isOpen` state to auto-manage focus
- Return key executes selected option (Allow/Deny)
- Has clear "enter this component" behavior via focus push

## Current Keyboard Handling Chain

```
TimelineViewport.useInput() -> 
  if (left/right/return) onItemInteraction(selectedItemIndex, input, key) ->
    TimelineDisplay.handleItemInteraction() ->
      if (left) emitCollapse()
      if (right) emitExpand()
      // Return key currently does nothing
```

## DelegateToolRenderer Focus

- Uses `useLaceFocus(FocusRegions.delegate(threadId))` but doesn't handle `isFocused` state
- No keyboard input handling of its own
- TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox doesn't have focus capability

## Missing Patterns

- No "enter this item" vs "navigate to this item" distinction  
- No nested focus handling for timeline items
- Return key at timeline level is passed through but unused
- No way for timeline items to become interactive focus contexts

For nested delegation timeline, need:
1. Return key on delegate item to "enter" the delegation (push focus)
2. Escape to "exit" back to parent timeline (pop focus)  
3. DelegateToolRenderer to handle its own keyboard when focused
4. Way to indicate visually when "in" vs "on" a delegate item
