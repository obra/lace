## Project Notes

SOLUTION IDENTIFIED FOR TIMELINE FOCUS ISOLATION

**Root Cause:**
The issue is that both the main timeline and delegate timeline use the same focus region (`FocusRegions.timeline`). When either timeline gets focus, both TimelineViewport instances think they should be active and respond to keyboard events.

**Current Structure:**
- Main timeline: `ConversationDisplay` → `TimelineDisplay` → `TimelineViewport` → `useLaceFocus(FocusRegions.timeline)`
- Delegate timeline: `DelegateToolRenderer` → `TimelineDisplay` → `TimelineViewport` → `useLaceFocus(FocusRegions.timeline)`

**Solution:**
1. **Modify TimelineViewport** to accept an optional `focusRegion` prop
2. **Update TimelineDisplay** to pass through the focus region prop
3. **Modify DelegateToolRenderer** to pass a delegate-specific focus region to its embedded TimelineDisplay

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Add `focusRegion?: string` prop to TimelineViewport
2. Add `focusRegion?: string` prop to TimelineDisplay
3. Pass the focus region from TimelineDisplay to TimelineViewport
4. In DelegateToolRenderer, pass `FocusRegions.delegate(delegateThreadId)` as the focus region
5. Main timeline will continue using the default `FocusRegions.timeline`

This ensures only one timeline can be focused at a time, and the delegate timeline uses its own focus space.
