## Project Notes

## Timeline Focus Isolation Analysis

Recent commits fixed the timeline focus issues through several key improvements:

### 1. Core Problem Solved
**Issue**: Multiple timelines (main + delegate) were responding to the same keyboard events, causing interference.

**Solution**: Implemented focus region isolation where each timeline has its own focus scope and only processes events when focused.

### 2. Key Architectural Changes

**A. Focus Region Scoping (TimelineViewport.tsx lines 85-99)**:
- Main timeline uses `FocusRegions.timeline` 
- Delegate timelines use `FocusRegions.delegate(threadId)`
- TimelineViewport checks current focus context before processing keys
- Prevents main timeline from handling keys when in delegate context

**B. Event Emitter Isolation (useTimelineExpansionToggle.tsx)**:
- Each `TimelineExpansionProvider` creates its own `ExpansionEmitter` instance
- Timeline-to-item communication isolated within provider scope
- Multiple timelines don't interfere with each other's expansion events

**C. Keyboard Delegation (DelegateToolRenderer.tsx lines 71-83)**:
- Escape key handled locally in delegate renderer
- Delegate timeline wrapped with isolated expansion provider
- Local expansion state (`delegationExpanded`) for internal control

### 3. Debugging Tools Added
- Added `/debug-focus` command to toggle focus debug panel
- Provides real-time visibility into focus stack and state
- Helps developers understand which component has focus

### 4. Test Coverage
- `timeline-focus-isolation.test.tsx`: Tests focus region separation
- `timeline-focus-integration.test.tsx`: E2E focus lifecycle tests
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error conditions

### 5. What Was Fixed
✅ Arrow key interference between main and delegate timelines
✅ Escape key not working to exit delegate focus
✅ Multiple timelines responding to same keyboard events
✅ Focus state management across timeline instances
✅ Event bubbling causing unintended navigation

### 6. Architecture Quality
The solution demonstrates excellent architectural patterns:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Composable isolation using React context
- Predictable focus behavior
- Testable interfaces
- No global state pollution

This is a robust solution that should handle complex scenarios like nested delegates and multiple concurrent timelines without issues.
