## Project Notes

I was implementing Task 4.1: Add Performance Monitoring and encountered a variable naming conflict. But Jesse just asked if this is for a debug panel, which makes me think I might be over-engineering the solution.

Looking at what I was doing:
1. Found that StreamingTimelineProcessor already has comprehensive performance monitoring (getMetrics, getPerformanceSummary methods)
2. Added performance logging to ConversationDisplay for timeline rendering
3. Was adding a Ctrl+P keyboard shortcut to show performance metrics in an alert modal

But there's already a debug panel system in the codebase (FocusDebugPanel) and Jesse's question suggests maybe I should be using that instead, or maybe the performance monitoring doesn't need a UI component at all.

The original plan called for "Add Performance Monitoring" but the monitoring was already there. I was adding ways to display it, but that might not be what's actually needed.
