## Project Notes

Currently working on Task 4.1: Add Performance Monitoring. I've successfully added:
- Performance metrics tracking in StreamingTimelineProcessor (getMetrics, getPerformanceSummary methods)
- Performance monitoring in ConversationDisplay with timing logs
- Additional performance tests

However, hit a TypeScript compilation error where `showPerformanceMetrics` function is referenced in SigintHandler component but defined in TerminalInterface component. Need to fix the scoping by passing the function as a prop to SigintHandler.

The performance monitoring implementation is comprehensive - StreamingTimelineProcessor already had most of the metrics I wanted to add. The plan called for adding performance monitoring, but the processor already tracked:
- Total/average/max append times
- Fast path vs slow path hits
- Event processing counts
- Performance summary formatting

I added the missing pieces: ConversationDisplay timeline rendering performance logs and the keyboard shortcut to display metrics.
