## Project Notes

Jesse is pushing back on my over-engineering and asking the right architectural question. The multi-agent architecture doc shows the future vision, but for building the web UI correctly NOW, I need to understand:

1. Is Agent the right event emitter for conversation-level events? YES
2. Is ThreadManager the right event emitter for thread-level events? YES
3. Do we need a SessionManager for session-level events? PROBABLY

For the immediate web UI work, Agent is still correct because:
- Agent handles conversation flow (thinking, streaming, tool execution)
- Agent emits the events that UIs need to render conversations
- Multiple agents = multiple event streams that web UI aggregates

ThreadManager is correct for thread-level events:
- Thread updates, compaction, persistence
- But not conversation rendering events

The web UI architecture should be built to handle multiple agents emitting events, but each agent is still the right place for conversation events.
