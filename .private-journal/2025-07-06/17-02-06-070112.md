## Project Notes

Jesse wants performance monitoring implemented as a slash command `/debug-ui-performance` rather than a keyboard shortcut. This follows the existing debug command pattern in the codebase. I need to:

1. Remove the keyboard shortcut and alert modal approach I was implementing
2. Look at existing debug commands to understand the pattern
3. Implement `/debug-ui-performance` as a slash command that outputs performance metrics

This is much cleaner and more consistent with the codebase architecture.
