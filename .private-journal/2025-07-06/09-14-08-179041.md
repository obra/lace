## Project Notes

Critical architectural analysis for Lace multi-UI support:

**Current State**: 
- ThreadManager has single `_currentThread` constraint
- Agents are NOT singletons (multiple instances possible)
- SQLite WAL mode supports concurrent readers
- Event-sourcing provides immutable conversation history

**Multi-Reader Support**: Ready now with minimal changes
**Multi-Writer Support**: Requires coordination layer

**Implementation Priority**:
1. Phase 1: Enable multiple read-only UIs (immediate)
2. Phase 2: Add write coordination/locking (medium effort) 
3. Phase 3: True concurrent editing (major architecture change)

**Key Files to Modify**:
- ThreadManager: Make stateless, always load from DB
- Agent: Already supports multiple instances
- ThreadProcessor: Already handles event processing per-UI
- Database: Already has WAL mode for concurrency

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for implementing multi-UI support incrementally.
