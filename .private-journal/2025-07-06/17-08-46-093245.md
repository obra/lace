## Project Notes

Starting Task 4.2: Fix Delegate Thread Performance Issue. According to the plan, this task is about ensuring delegate threads don't contaminate main timeline processing. The plan mentions this was identified as a major performance contributor in the original analysis.

The key points from the plan:
1. Test that main timeline only processes main thread events
2. Test that delegate threads are processed separately  
3. Verify Agent.getThreadEvents() returns only main thread events
4. Test that delegate tool rendering works independently
5. The plan notes that Agent should use getEvents(), not getMainAndDelegateEvents()

I need to examine:
- src/agents/agent.ts - Thread event fetching methods
- src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/DelegateToolRenderer.tsx - Independent delegate processing
- How delegate threads are currently handled in the streaming timeline system
