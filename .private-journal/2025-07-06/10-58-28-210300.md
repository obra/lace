## Project Notes

Analyzing the event architecture coupling issue Jesse identified. Current system has two event sources that interfaces consume directly:

1. **Agent** - 19 event types for conversation flow, tools, state, tokens, turns, retries
2. **ThreadManager** - 2 event types for thread updates and real-time event streaming  

Key coupling points:
- TerminalInterface subscribes to both Agent and ThreadManager events
- Agent exposes ThreadManager publicly (lines 93-96 in agent.ts)
- Interface accesses ThreadManager directly via React context
- Commands/tools bypass Agent to manipulate threads

The fundamental issue: interfaces need to understand TWO event models instead of one unified model through Agent.

Jesse's Agent-as-facade proposal would:
- Make Agent the single event source
- Hide ThreadManager completely behind Agent  
- Simplify interface event handling
- Reduce coupling between interface and data layers

This aligns with the documented three-layer architecture where Agent should be the interface to the Logic Layer, not ThreadManager.
