## Project Notes

Delegate tool refactoring complete. The key insight was that delegate threads aren't just separate threads but separate Agent instances. This required:

1. Adding `createDelegateAgent()` method to Agent class (still needs implementation)
2. Updating delegate tool to use parent agent instead of ThreadManager
3. Comprehensive test updates to mock the new subagent pattern

Current status: Phase 4 of unexpose-thread-manager plan - compilation errors fixed, ready to continue with removing ThreadManager public getter and React context.

Next: Need to implement the actual `createDelegateAgent()` method in Agent class, then remove ThreadManager public access.
