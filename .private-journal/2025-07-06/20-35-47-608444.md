## Project Notes

Issues with anchor viewport implementation:
- Cursor not visible: positioning logic probably wrong
- Item selection broken: anchor updates or selection logic failing  
- Can't reach last item: navigation bounds or window calculation issue
- Mixed coordinate systems: old system used lines, new uses pixels inconsistently
- Missing height constraints: removed explicit viewport height

Need to debug systematically and fix the coordinate system consistency.
