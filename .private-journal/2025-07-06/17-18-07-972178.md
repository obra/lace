## Project Notes

Starting Task 4.3: Load Testing and Optimization - the final task in the streaming timeline implementation plan. This task involves creating comprehensive performance tests to validate that the StreamingTimelineProcessor maintains O(1) behavior at scale.

From the plan, Task 4.3 should include:
1. Write load test with 1000+ events to simulate very long conversations
2. Write test measuring CPU usage during event processing  
3. Write test for memory leak detection over extended use
4. Implement any needed optimizations based on test results
5. Commit: "test: add comprehensive streaming timeline performance tests"

The load test scenarios should cover:
- Small conversation: 10 events, verify O(1) behavior
- Medium conversation: 100 events, verify stable performance  
- Large conversation: 1000+ events, verify no performance degradation
- Sustained usage: Add events continuously, verify no memory leaks

I need to create comprehensive load tests that validate the O(1) performance promise of StreamingTimelineProcessor across different conversation sizes.
