## Project Notes

The multi-agent architecture completely reframes the web UI question. Key changes to my recommendation:

1. **Sessions as containers**: Web UI needs to manage sessions (parent threads) containing multiple agents
2. **Agent switching**: Web UI needs tabs/switching like terminal UI will have
3. **Task management**: Web UI needs task dashboard, assignment management
4. **Real-time coordination**: Multiple agents working simultaneously, need WebSocket updates across all agents
5. **Message queueing**: Web UI needs to handle queued messages for busy agents
6. **Thread versioning**: Web UI needs to understand canonical IDs and compaction

The fundamental architecture (shared Agent instances with event broadcasting) is still correct, but now it's multiple Agent instances in a session, not just one. The web UI becomes more complex but also more powerful.

Web UI architectural considerations:
- Session management (create/resume sessions)
- Agent management (spawn/switch/monitor agents)
- Task management (create/assign/monitor tasks)
- Real-time updates (WebSocket for all agents in session)
- Message queue UI (show queued messages per agent)
- Thread version handling (canonical ID stability)
