## Project Notes

User requirements for scrolling system:
- Line-based scrolling (arrow keys move by line, not item)
- Startup: last item's bottom at viewport bottom
- Keep windowing/lazy loading performance benefits
- Cursor should be visible and line-based

Need to modify anchor system to be line-aware:
- Track selectedLine (absolute line within rendered content)
- Keep lineScrollOffset for viewport positioning
- Anchor system can still manage windowing
- Navigation should update selectedLine, not anchor.itemIndex directly
