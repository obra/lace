## Project Notes

Successfully fixed the two failing test files that Jesse specifically requested:
- src/agents/agent-abort.test.ts 
- src/agents/agent-token-tracking.test.ts

Both files now pass all tests. The key changes were:
1. Updated MockProvider classes to work with model-agnostic architecture
2. Added required model metadata to all agent instances
3. Fixed method signatures to include _model parameter
4. Replaced Object.defineProperty patterns with direct getter implementations

There are other agent tests still failing with the same "No model configured" error, but those were not part of this specific task scope.
