## Project Notes

Provider Refactor - Caching Issue Resolution

Fixed the persistent "Missing API key" error that was happening even after credentials were properly configured. The issue was in Session.resolveProviderInstance() which was caching providers indefinitely, including ones created without valid credentials.

Changes made:
1. Modified Session.resolveProviderInstance() to validate cached providers before reusing
2. Added Session.clearProviderCache() to stop agent route as temporary workaround
3. Added cache clearing to session creation to ensure fresh start

The provider cache now properly invalidates entries when the cached provider is not configured, forcing recreation with fresh credentials. This fixes the issue where the UI would show correct provider/model but API calls would fail with missing credentials.
