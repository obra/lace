## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to finish task 1.8 first and emphasizes writing tests that don't mock the behavior under test. This is a good reminder - I should write integration tests that actually test the real API endpoints with real database interactions, not mocked behavior.

Task 1.8 is "Web API - Project Endpoints" and it's currently marked as "PARTIALLY COMPLETED (basic endpoints created)". I need to:

1. Check what's already implemented for project endpoints
2. Write proper integration tests that don't mock the behavior under test
3. Fix any issues with the endpoints
4. Make sure they work end-to-end

Let me start by checking what project API endpoints exist and what tests are already there.
