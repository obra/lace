## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to finish implementing Phase 1 based on the current planning document. Looking at the phase1-mvp.md file, I can see the critical blocking issue:

**Task 1.9 is BLOCKED** because the Project class is missing the session management methods that the API endpoints are trying to call:
- `project.getSessions()` - Not implemented (commented out as TODO)
- `project.createSession()` - Not implemented (commented out as TODO)  
- `project.getSession()` - Not implemented (commented out as TODO)
- `project.updateSession()` - Not implemented (commented out as TODO)
- `project.deleteSession()` - Not implemented (commented out as TODO)

The API endpoints are already implemented and calling these methods, but they don't exist yet in the Project class. This is the main thing blocking Phase 1 completion.

I need to implement these missing Project class methods first, then the session API endpoints should work properly.
