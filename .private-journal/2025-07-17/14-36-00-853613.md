## Project Notes

Jesse wants to continue working on the Phase 1 MVP planning document. From the previous conversation, I discovered that:

1. The API endpoints I created call Project class methods that don't exist yet (they're commented out as TODOs in the Project class)
2. The planning documentation incorrectly shows using `Session.getSessionsByProject()` static methods when our implementation uses `Project.getSessions()` instance methods
3. Task 1.9 is actually BLOCKED because the required Project class methods don't exist yet
4. I identified missing elements in the Phase 1 plan like database migration testing, backward compatibility strategy, error handling, and CLI integration

Jesse asked "anything else that should be in that stage 1 plan?" and now wants to keep working on the phase1-mvp.md document. I should focus on adding the missing critical elements I identified to make the Phase 1 plan more complete and accurate.
