## Project Notes

Jesse specifically asked to fix Session test failures after we successfully converted from lazy to eager persistence initialization. The 5 failing tests are in the "Session class project support" section - these tests try to verify real Session functionality but are blocked by extensive mocking.

Current approach adds missing mock methods to make tests pass, but Jesse values testing real functionality over mocked behavior. Should consider if we want to do a similar rewrite like we did with API endpoints test.
