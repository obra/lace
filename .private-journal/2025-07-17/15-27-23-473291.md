## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to complete Task 1.10: Basic Web UI for Projects. Looking at the planning document, this was marked as "PARTIALLY COMPLETED (basic components created)". I need to check what's already implemented and what needs to be done to complete it.

From the planning document, I can see that basic UI components were created but need polish and full functionality. I should:

1. Check what UI components already exist
2. See what's missing or needs improvement
3. Polish the components and add full functionality
4. Make sure they integrate properly with the API endpoints I just completed
5. Test the UI end-to-end

Let me start by checking what UI components are already there.
