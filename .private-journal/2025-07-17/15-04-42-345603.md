## Project Notes

Jesse is asking if I completed task 1.10 and wants me to update the planning doc. Looking back at the conversation, I can see that:

1. I implemented the missing Project class session management methods (task 1.9 was blocked on this)
2. But I didn't actually complete task 1.10 which was "Basic Web UI for Projects"

Looking at the planning doc, task 1.10 was marked as "PARTIALLY COMPLETED" - basic UI components were created but needed full integration. I should check if the session API endpoints now work properly (since I fixed the Project class methods), and then update the planning doc accordingly.

I need to be honest that I didn't complete task 1.10 - I only completed the blocking issue for task 1.9.
