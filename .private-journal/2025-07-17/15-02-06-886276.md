## Project Notes

Jesse is asking what's next after completing Phase 1 MVP. Looking at the planning documentation, I should check what the next phase is. From what I remember, there was Phase 2 which focused on configuration and policies, and Phase 3 for advanced features.

Let me check the current state and what the next logical step would be. Since Phase 1 MVP is complete, we should either:
1. Move to Phase 2 features
2. Polish and test Phase 1 more thoroughly
3. Check if there are any remaining issues with Phase 1

I should look at the planning docs to see what Phase 2 entails.
