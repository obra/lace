## Project Notes

Jesse is right - hardcoding localhost:3000 is wrong. I need to think about this properly and research the right way to test Next.js 15 API routes.

The issue is that I'm trying to test server-side API routes that use server-only imports, but I'm approaching it wrong. Let me think about the proper approaches:

1. **Use Next.js testing utilities**: Next.js might have official testing utilities for API routes
2. **Use a test server**: Set up a proper test server that can handle the server-only imports
3. **Use mocking correctly**: Maybe there's a proper way to mock server-only for tests
4. **Use @next/test**: There might be official Next.js testing tools
5. **Use MSW or similar**: Mock Service Worker or similar tools for API testing

I should research what the official Next.js 15 documentation says about testing API routes, especially with server-only imports.
