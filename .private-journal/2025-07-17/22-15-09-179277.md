## Project Notes

I've now completed a comprehensive analysis of the current project management system in the Lace codebase. Here's what I've discovered:

## Current Architecture Analysis

### What's Already Implemented:

1. **Complete API Layer**: Full REST API for projects at `/api/projects/`:
   - GET /api/projects - List all projects
   - POST /api/projects - Create new project
   - GET /api/projects/[id] - Get project by ID
   - PATCH /api/projects/[id] - Update project
   - DELETE /api/projects/[id] - Delete project
   - GET /api/projects/[id]/configuration - Get project configuration
   - PUT /api/projects/[id]/configuration - Update project configuration
   - GET /api/projects/[id]/sessions - Get project sessions
   - POST /api/projects/[id]/sessions - Create new session in project

2. **Database Schema**: Complete SQLite schema with:
   - projects table with all necessary fields (id, name, description, working_directory, configuration, is_archived, etc.)
   - sessions table with foreign key to projects
   - Full CRUD operations implemented in DatabasePersistence class

3. **Business Logic Layer**: 
   - Project class with comprehensive methods (create, getAll, getById, updateInfo, updateConfiguration, archive, delete)
   - Session class with project integration (createWithDefaults requires projectId)
   - Proper project-session relationship management

4. **Web UI Components**:
   - ProjectManager component with full CRUD operations
   - ProjectSettings component with comprehensive configuration UI (4 tabs: General, AI Configuration, Tools, Environment Variables)
   - CreateProjectModal for new project creation
   - useProjectAPI hook for API interactions

5. **Main Page Integration**: 
   - Projects are shown in sidebar
   - Sessions are only shown when project is selected
   - Project selection drives session creation and management

### What's Missing/Gaps:

1. **ProjectSettings Integration**: The ProjectSettings component exists but is NOT actually used in the main UI. There's no way to open project settings from the ProjectManager.

2. **Configuration Loading**: The ProjectSettings component expects project configuration data but the current API doesn't fetch it properly.

3. **Provider/Model Discovery**: The ProjectSettings component has hardcoded provider/model options instead of using the /api/providers endpoint.

4. **Session Configuration**: No UI for session-level configuration overrides.

5. **Working Directory Management**: No file browser or working directory selector.

### Current Data Flow:

1. User selects project → ProjectManager calls onProjectSelect
2. Main page shows sessions for selected project
3. User creates session → Uses project-based session creation
4. Sessions are properly linked to projects in database

### Missing Integration Points:

1. No "Settings" button in ProjectManager to open ProjectSettings
2. No way to edit project configuration after creation
3. ProjectSettings component needs to be wired up to actually save changes
4. No real-time provider/model discovery in settings

The core architecture is solid and well-implemented. The main gap is the UI integration for project settings management.
