## Project Notes

Successfully fixed the Session tests by:
1. Removing extensive mocking of persistence layer, ProviderRegistry, ThreadManager, etc.
2. Using real persistence with temporary databases via setupTestPersistence/teardownTestPersistence
3. Mocking only external dependencies (tools, API providers) to avoid file system/network calls
4. Adjusting test expectations to match real Session behavior vs mocked behavior
5. All 24 Session tests now pass, verifying real functionality instead of mock behavior

Result: Converted from 580+ lines of complex mocks to ~200 lines of real functionality testing, similar to the API endpoints rewrite we did earlier.
