## Project Notes

We're in the middle of recovering from ANOTHER git revert incident. Looking at the session log, we had successfully recovered all Phase 1 MVP functionality including:

**Successfully Fixed (according to session log):**
- database.ts: All project persistence methods restored
- Project class: Proper configuration architecture with getConfiguration() method
- Session class: Integration with projects working
- ThreadManager: Session support restored  
- All 2008 tests passing
- Hundreds of TypeScript/linting errors fixed

**Current State (files on disk):**
- project.ts has the exact same issues we were fixing when interrupted
- Constructor signature mismatch (takes projectId but called with actualDbPath)
- Missing _dbPath field but methods try to use it
- Session.getById() called with dbPath parameter it doesn't accept
- project.test.ts is still mocked instead of integration tests

**What likely happened:**
1. The commit may not have included all our fixes
2. Files may have been reverted again
3. We may be on the wrong branch
4. Pre-commit hooks may have caused issues

**Recovery plan:**
1. First verify what's actually in the last commit vs what's on disk
2. Check if we're on the right branch
3. Systematically fix the Project class persistence pattern
4. Convert tests from mocked to integration
5. Be very careful about the commit process this time

The recurring pattern is concerning - we keep losing the same work. Need to understand why this keeps happening.
