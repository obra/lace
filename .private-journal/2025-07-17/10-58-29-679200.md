## Project Notes

The existing database schema at ~/.lace/lace.db is completely different from what I reconstructed. It has:

1. Different column names and structure in threads table
2. Additional tables: thread_versions, version_history, tasks, task_notes  
3. Different sessions table structure with project_id FK
4. Missing approvals table that I included

This suggests the lost work involved adapting to an existing schema rather than creating a new one. I should examine the existing database structure more carefully and update my reconstruction to match what's actually there.

The database is at version 6 but has evolved differently than my migration chain. This is a good reminder to always check existing state before reconstructing from memory.
