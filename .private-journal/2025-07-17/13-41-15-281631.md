## Project Notes

Current Lace persistence architecture analysis:

**Key Files Examined:**
- `/src/persistence/database.ts` - Centralized SQLite persistence layer
- `/src/threads/thread-manager.ts` - Thread management using global persistence
- `/src/sessions/session.ts` - Session management with project support
- `/src/projects/project.ts` - Project management interface

**Architecture Changes from Docs:**
1. **Global Persistence**: Single `DatabasePersistence` instance manages all data
2. **No dbPath Parameters**: Managers don't take database paths - they use global instance
3. **Rich Schema**: 6 migration versions show evolution from basic threads to full project/session hierarchy
4. **Session Evolution**: Sessions are now first-class entities in their own table, not just thread metadata
5. **Project Integration**: Projects are implemented and integrated with sessions

**Current State:**
- ThreadManager: Uses global persistence, no longer manages own DB connection
- SessionManager: Replaced by Session class that uses global persistence
- ProjectManager: Replaced by Project class that uses global persistence
- All persistence goes through single global instance initialized at app startup

The architecture is more mature and centralized than documented. The docs appear to be outdated.
