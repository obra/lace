## Project Notes

Jesse is questioning whether mocking server-only is the right approach for Next.js 15. They're right to be concerned - mocking server-only feels like a hack and might not be the proper way to handle this in Next.js 15.

Let me think about this:

1. The issue is that we're trying to import server-side code in a test environment
2. In Next.js 15, server-only is used to ensure code only runs on the server
3. For API route tests, we should be able to test the actual server code without mocking server-only
4. The problem might be in how we're structuring the tests or the import paths

Looking at the vitest config, I see it has:
- environment: 'node' by default
- environmentMatchGlobs that specify 'node' for API route tests
- But there might be a conflict with how Next.js handles server-only imports

Instead of mocking server-only, I should:
1. Check if there's a proper way to test Next.js API routes in Next.js 15
2. Maybe use a different approach for importing the Project class directly
3. Or set up the test environment properly for Next.js 15

Let me research what the proper approach is for Next.js 15 API route testing.
