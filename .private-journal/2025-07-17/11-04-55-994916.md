## Project Notes

Ah, I see the architectural deviation now. The original plan had session and project methods in ThreadManager, but Jesse's team decided to move them to dedicated classes:

- Session methods → src/sessions/session.ts  
- Project methods → src/projects/project.ts

This is actually a better separation of concerns. ThreadManager should focus on thread operations, while Session and Project classes handle their own domain logic. This follows single responsibility principle better.

So the work lost was:
1. Database.ts - project persistence methods (now restored)
2. Session class - should use database persistence directly
3. Project class - should use database persistence directly  
4. ThreadManager - should NOT have session/project methods (contrary to original plan)

Need to check what's missing from the Session and Project classes.
