## Project Notes

Working on comprehensive documentation for Lace. The codebase is quite mature and well-architected:

- Event sourcing with immutable ThreadEvents
- Clean provider abstraction supporting multiple AI models  
- Sophisticated thinking block processing with dual-path architecture
- Performance-optimized UI with caching and incremental processing
- Comprehensive tool system with approval workflows
- SQLite persistence with graceful fallback

Architecture documentation completed. Now need to identify improvement opportunities - will focus on areas like:
- Performance bottlenecks in large conversations
- Developer experience improvements
- Testing infrastructure gaps
- Potential architectural debt
- Scalability considerations
