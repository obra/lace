## Project Notes

Analyzed the Lace AI coding assistant codebase structure. Key architectural findings:

**Core Architecture:**
- Event-sourcing based conversational AI system built with TypeScript/Node.js
- Clean separation: Data Layer (ThreadManager/Persistence) → Logic Layer (Agent/Tools) → Interface Layer (Terminal/Web/API)
- SQLite-based persistence with graceful degradation to memory-only operation
- Support for multiple AI providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, LMStudio, Ollama

**Key Components:**
- **Agent System**: Event-driven conversation engine with streaming, tool orchestration, token management
- **Tool System**: 11 tools including file ops (read/write/edit/insert/list/find), bash, ripgrep, url-fetch, task-manager, delegate
- **Terminal Interface**: Rich Ink/React-based UI with real-time updates, tool approval modals, autocomplete
- **Provider Abstraction**: Normalized interface across different AI providers
- **Thread Management**: Resumable conversations, delegation support, event sourcing

**Technology Stack:**
- TypeScript with strict mode, ES modules
- Vitest for testing (unit/integration/E2E)
- React + Ink for terminal UI
- SQLite for persistence
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Husky for git hooks

**Testing Strategy:**
- Comprehensive test coverage: unit, integration, E2E
- Co-located test files (.test.ts next to source)
- Mock factories for external dependencies
- JSDoc environment for React components

**Build & Development:**
- npm scripts for build/test/lint
- TypeScript compilation to dist/
- Coverage reporting
- Pre-commit hooks for quality gates

The codebase is well-structured, follows modern TypeScript patterns, has comprehensive documentation and testing. The event-sourcing architecture makes it extensible for new interfaces and providers.
