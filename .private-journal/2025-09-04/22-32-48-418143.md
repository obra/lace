## Project Notes

The settings modal structure:
- Providers tab (provider instances, catalogs)
- UI tab (theme settings, appearance)  
- User tab (user preferences)

Jesse is saying MCP should be integrated into this existing structure, likely in the Providers tab since MCP is about extending capabilities through external services, similar to AI providers.

I made the mistake of creating a separate MCP tab when I should have integrated MCP settings into the existing Providers or UI tabs.
