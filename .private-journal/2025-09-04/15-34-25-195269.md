## Project Notes

Configuration Inheritance Clarification

Important correction from Jesse:
When project servers replace global servers, they should NOT inherit global "allow-always" settings. This means:
- Project server replacement is truly complete replacement
- No inheritance of tool policies from global when server is overridden
- Clean slate for project-specific server configurations

Also need MCP server management API routes for web interface:
- GET/POST for server configurations
- Tool policy management endpoints
- Server status/health endpoints
- Runtime server control (start/stop/restart)

This means packages/web needs API routes in addition to UI components.
