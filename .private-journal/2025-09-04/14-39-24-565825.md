## Project Notes

Architecture Decision Update

Jesse reconsidering B → D for server management:

D) Registry pattern: 
- Keep ToolExecutor unchanged
- MCPToolRegistry + MCPServerManager as separate cooperating services
- More modular, less coupling to existing ToolExecutor
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to test and maintain independently

This aligns better with Lace's modular architecture and keeps the existing ToolExecutor clean.
