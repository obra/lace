## Project Notes

Phase 3 Analysis - Integration with Existing Systems

From the revised implementation plan, Phase 3 was:
1. Task 3.1: Extend Approval Types ✅ (they did this)
2. Task 3.2: Integrate MCP with ToolExecutor ✅ (they did this)

The original plan had Phase 4 as Web Interface/API routes, which they completely skipped.

So for Phase 3 specifically - yes, they did complete it correctly. The ToolExecutor integration looks solid:
- MCP registry initialization in constructor
- Tool registration from MCP servers  
- Approval level checking for MCP tools
- Allow-always bypass logic
- Proper cleanup on shutdown

But Jesse might be thinking of the original plan where Phase 3 included API routes, which they definitely didn't do.
