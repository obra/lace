## Project Notes

MCP Configuration Structure Decision

A) Single config file approach:
- One `mcp-config.json` at each level (global/project) 
- Servers and tool policies in same file
- Simpler for users to manage
- Less file proliferation
- Easier to see complete MCP configuration at a glance

Configuration hierarchy:
- ~/.lace/mcp-config.json (global)
- {project}/.lace/mcp-config.json (project-specific)  
- Session config would be runtime state, not file-based

Need to understand the config file schema structure next - how servers, tools, and policies are organized within the single file.
