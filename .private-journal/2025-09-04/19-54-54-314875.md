## Project Notes

Critical Plan Error Discovery

The implementer is pointing out that my revised implementation plan (`mcp-tasks-revised.md`) doesn't include the web interface tasks that Jesse and I originally specified:
- API routes for server management
- Settings pages for MCP configuration  
- Server status monitoring UI
- Tool policy management interface

When I rewrote the plan to fix the JSON-RPC mistake, I apparently only included the core infrastructure work and left out all the web interface components. This explains why they completed "all phases" so quickly - my revised plan was missing half the work!

The implementer correctly implemented everything in MY plan, but my plan was incomplete compared to the original spec Jesse and I designed.
