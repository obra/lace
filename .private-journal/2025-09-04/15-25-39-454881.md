## Project Notes

MCP Configuration Merging Decision

B) Server-level replace:
- If server exists in both global and project configs, project version completely replaces global
- Clean, predictable behavior - no complex merging rules to remember
- Project config has full control when it needs to override a server
- Simple mental model for users

Configuration loading:
1. Load global mcp-config.json
2. Load project mcp-config.json  
3. For any server that exists in both, use project version entirely
4. Servers that only exist in global remain as-is
5. Session state tracks runtime approvals/tool states

This gives projects full control when needed while keeping the logic simple.

Architecture summary complete - should present design overview next.
