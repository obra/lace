## Project Notes

Tool Integration Architecture Decision

Jesse noted: "we designed our tools data model to match MCP" - this is KEY insight
Options C (Adapter pattern) or D (Registry abstraction) are both viable

Since Lace's tool data model already matches MCP, the translation layer should be minimal.

C) MCPToolAdapter: Dynamic Zod schema generation from MCP JSON Schema
- Pro: Reuses existing Tool base class and all approval/execution logic
- Pro: Type safety through Zod validation 
- Con: JSON Schema → Zod conversion complexity

D) MCPToolRegistry: Separate registry presenting unified interface
- Pro: Clean separation of concerns
- Pro: Can optimize for MCP-specific features
- Con: Potential code duplication in approval/execution logic

Need to understand current Tool interface better to determine which preserves more existing logic.
