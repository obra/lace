## Project Notes

Extended Approval Levels Update

Jesse suggests adding "allow-always" in addition to the other new levels.

Complete approval level hierarchy:
- `disable`: Tool completely disabled 
- `deny`: Tool available but always denied
- `require-approval`: Tool requires user approval each time
- `allow-once`: Approved for single use
- `allow-session`: Approved for current conversation session
- `allow-project`: Approved for entire project duration  
- `allow-always`: Approved permanently (global setting)

This gives complete granularity from never-use to always-use with all intermediate levels.
