## Project Notes

API Route Structure Refinement

Jesse suggests tools routes should be nested under server routes - makes logical sense:
- Tools belong to servers
- Tool policies are server-specific  
- Cleaner hierarchical URL structure
- More intuitive REST API design

Updated structure:
```
/api/mcp/servers/
├── route.ts                        # GET/POST server list
└── [serverId]/
    ├── route.ts                    # GET/PUT/DELETE specific server  
    ├── status/route.ts             # GET server health/status
    ├── control/route.ts            # POST start/stop/restart
    └── tools/
        ├── route.ts                # GET tools for this server
        └── [toolId]/
            └── policy/route.ts     # GET/PUT tool approval policy
```
