## Project Notes

Critical Error Discovery

Jesse caught a major mistake in my implementation plan. I assumed we needed to implement raw JSON-RPC communication, but the @modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk likely provides high-level client abstractions that handle all the JSON-RPC details.

I should have studied the actual MCP TypeScript SDK before writing the implementation plan. This is exactly the kind of error that wastes engineering time and leads to over-engineering.

Need to:
1. Study the actual MCP TypeScript SDK implementation
2. Understand what abstractions it provides
3. Revise the implementation plan to use the SDK properly
4. Likely simplify significantly since we won't need custom JSON-RPC handling
