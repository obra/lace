## Project Notes

Phase 2 Review Setup

Jesse is concerned about implementer completing Phase 2 too quickly - this is a red flag for:
- Copy-paste implementation without understanding
- AI-generated code that compiles but has issues
- Shortcuts in implementation quality
- Missing edge cases or error handling
- Tests that look comprehensive but don't actually test real scenarios

Phase 2 should include:
- MCPToolRegistry with tool discovery
- Integration with existing ToolExecutor
- Extended approval system
- Complex event handling and lifecycle management

Need to examine very carefully for:
1. Code quality vs speed tradeoff
2. Test depth and realistic scenarios  
3. Edge case handling
4. Integration points with existing systems
5. Whether complexity matches what should be required
