## Project Notes

Major lesson learned: MCP integration requires MUCH more than just the core SDK integration:

1. **Configuration Management**: Need write APIs, not just read-only config loading
2. **Web UI Integration**: Server management interface, tool policy controls, real-time status
3. **API Routes**: REST endpoints for server control, configuration updates
4. **Real Testing**: Actual MCP server spawning and tool execution validation
5. **User Workflow**: Complete user journey from configuration to tool usage

The core infrastructure I built (types, server manager, tool registry, tool adapter) is solid foundation but useless without the user-facing layer. Need to always think about the complete user experience, not just the technical implementation.

Architecture patterns that worked:
- Event-driven server/tool discovery
- Integration with existing ToolExecutor approval system
- SDK abstraction using official MCP client

But missing the entire management layer makes this unusable in practice.
