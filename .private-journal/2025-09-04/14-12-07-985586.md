## Project Notes

MCP Integration - Process Architecture Decision

Jesse confirmed: Hybrid approach (D) but corrected transport options to stdio + TCP (not worker threads)
Key constraint: MCP servers NEVER run in same process as Lace - always external processes for isolation

Transport options:
- stdio: spawn child processes, communicate via JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout  
- TCP: connect to already-running MCP servers on specified ports
- Need automatic fallback/retry logic
- Process isolation is critical for reliability and security

Next question should focus on configuration structure since we established additive config model earlier.
