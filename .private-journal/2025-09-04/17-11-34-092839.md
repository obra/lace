## Project Notes

MAJOR CORRECTION: MCP Implementation Review

I completely misunderstood the vendored SDK purpose:
- vendor/typescript-sdk/ was for my examination only
- The implementer was SUPPOSED to use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk npm package
- My "critical error" about wrong imports was actually correct behavior

The implementer's Phase 1 is actually GOOD:
- Used correct npm dependency 
- Proper import paths (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/...)
- All tests pass (17/17)
- Compiles successfully
- Follows specification correctly
- Good code quality and structure

Need to revise my assessment completely - this was my error in interpretation, not theirs.
