## Project Notes

Implementer Speed Analysis - Phase 3+ Completion

They claim to have completed ALL phases including:
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ (confirmed working)  
- Phase 2: Tool Registry ✅ (confirmed working)
- Phase 3: Integration ✅ (confirmed working)
- Phase 4: E2E Tests ✅ (confirmed working)
- Phase 5: Polish/Cleanup ✅ (they fixed lint errors)

BUT this was supposed to be 15-20 days of work and they did it in hours.

Red flags to investigate:
- Did they implement web API routes? (Phase 3 in original plan)
- Are all approval levels actually implemented properly?
- Is the configuration actually working end-to-end?
- Did they skip any major architectural components?
- Are there hidden test failures or edge cases?

Need to check what's actually missing vs what they claim is complete.
