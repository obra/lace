## Project Notes

MCP Integration Planning - Configuration Architecture

Current tool approval levels: 'approve for session', 'approve once', 'deny always'
Adding: 'approve for project', 'disable'

Configuration system design:
- Additive MCP server configuration (B)
- Global: defines base MCP servers
- Project: adds additional servers + can enable/disable tools + approval levels
- Session: enable/disable tools from combined pool + runtime approval decisions

Need to study existing tool system in packages/core/src/tools/ to understand:
- How current approval system works
- Tool registration and execution patterns
- Configuration persistence and loading
- Integration with ToolExecutor class

Key architectural goal: clean, maintainable system that extends current patterns rather than replacing them.
