## Project Notes

MCP Configuration Architecture Clarified

D) Server + Tool hybrid approach:
- Servers: enabled/disabled at server level (performance optimization - don't run unused servers)
- Tools: within enabled servers, individual tools can be configured with:
  - Enable/disable state
  - Approval policies (disable/deny/require-approval/allow-project/allow-session)

This matches existing tool system granularity but adds server-level control for efficiency.

Configuration hierarchy:
- Global: defines base MCP servers + their tool configurations
- Project: adds servers + overrides tool settings for project-specific needs  
- Session: runtime enable/disable + approval decisions for active conversation

Need to understand tool registration flow next - how MCP tools integrate with existing ToolExecutor.
