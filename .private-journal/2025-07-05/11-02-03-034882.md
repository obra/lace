## Project Notes

The failing thread lace_20250705_2opxkw is perfect test data because:
- It has 33 tool calls and 33 tool results (balanced)
- It contains the specific toolu_012RDexnDVgu6QthBGZZ45RH that caused the API failure
- It demonstrates the conversation building bug in isolation
- It can also be used to test compaction behavior

This is exactly the kind of real-world test data that catches bugs synthetic tests might miss.
