## Project Notes

The retry provider tests are failing because the Anthropic streaming retry test mock doesn't properly implement the stream interface. 

Looking at the differences:
- OpenAI test uses an async generator function that yields objects with choices/delta structure
- Anthropic test tries to mock an object with .on() and .finalMessage() methods
- The error "stream.on is not a function" means the mock isn't providing the expected interface

The Anthropic SDK stream has a different interface than OpenAI's - it uses event listeners (.on) and a finalMessage() method, while OpenAI uses async iterators.

The working OpenAI pattern: mockCreate.mockRejectedValueOnce(error).mockReturnValueOnce(asyncGenerator)
The failing Anthropic pattern: mockStream.mockRejectedValueOnce(error).mockReturnValueOnce(streamObject)

Need to fix the Anthropic stream mock to properly implement the event-based interface that the provider expects.
