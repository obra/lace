## Project Notes

Test suite successfully completed for conversation building regression. Key findings:

**Bug Reproduction Success:**
- Full thread data: 89 events with perfect balance (33 tool calls, 33 tool results)
- Conversation building logic: Creates orphaned tool results during processing
- Anthropic format conversion: Produces the exact API error scenario

**Test Coverage:**
- Full thread processing (89 events)
- Tool call/result pairing validation
- Anthropic format conversion
- Edge cases (orphaned calls/results)
- Real-world bug reproduction

**Critical Discovery:**
The bug occurs during data transformation, not in stored events. The _buildConversationFromEvents method or convertToAnthropicFormat function introduces orphaned tool results somewhere in the pipeline.

**Status:**
- Task 3 (comprehensive test suite) âœ… COMPLETED
- Task 4 (fix conversation building logic) ðŸ”„ READY TO START
- Tests now provide clear repro case for the bug

The failing tests correctly identify the exact problem that needs to be fixed.
