## Project Notes

I found the root cause of the Anthropic retry test failure. The issue is architectural:

1. The provider calls `this._anthropic.messages.stream()` to create a stream
2. The retry logic wraps the entire operation inside `withRetry()`
3. When the first attempt fails, it should fail at the `this._anthropic.messages.stream()` call
4. But the mock is set up to mock `mockStream` which is the `stream` method on the mock SDK
5. The mock setup `mockStream.mockRejectedValueOnce(networkError).mockReturnValueOnce(successfulStream)` means:
   - First call to `stream()` throws networkError
   - Second call to `stream()` returns successfulStream object
6. But the error is happening at `stream.on()` which means the stream object is being created but it's not the right type

The problem is that the `withRetry()` call is wrapping the entire function, but the stream is being accessed outside the try block. Looking at the code:

```typescript
// Use the streaming API
const stream = this._anthropic.messages.stream(requestPayload, {
  signal,
});

// Mark that stream is created to prevent retries after this point
streamCreated = true;

let toolCalls: ProviderToolCall[] = [];

try {
  // Handle streaming events - use the 'text' event for token-by-token streaming
  stream.on('text', (text) => {
```

The issue is that `stream` is created outside the try block, so if the first call fails, the stream variable is undefined, but the code still tries to call `stream.on()` on it.

Wait, that's not right either. Let me re-examine the withRetry wrapper in the anthropic provider.
