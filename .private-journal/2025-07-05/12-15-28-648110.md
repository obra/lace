## Project Notes

Jesse identified the exact compaction bug! Looking at summarize-strategy.ts:

**The Bug**:
- Lines 76-79: `isImportantEvent()` only preserves USER_MESSAGE and AGENT_MESSAGE
- TOOL_CALL and TOOL_RESULT events are summarized away
- Lines 244-263: compaction's `buildConversationFromEvents()` ignores tool events entirely
- Result: Agent messages with tool calls are preserved, but the actual tool events are lost

**Jesse's Fix**:
- Preserve TOOL_CALL events (small)
- Preserve first 3 lines of TOOL_RESULT + "[results truncated to save space.]"
- Maintains atomic pairing while saving tokens

**Implementation**:
Need to modify `isImportantEvent()` and add special TOOL_RESULT truncation logic. This is way cleaner than my synthetic message recovery hack.

The test suite I built for conversation building is working perfectly - it identified the real bug and my fix handles it. Now I need to apply the same approach to compaction.

Key files to modify:
- `/src/threads/compaction/summarize-strategy.ts` - fix event categorization
- Need new test suite for compaction using the same failing thread data
- Should be able to reuse the thread data from `conversation-building-regression.test.ts`
