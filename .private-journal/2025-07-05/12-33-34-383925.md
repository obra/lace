## Project Notes

LACE test suite is now fully passing except for one unrelated LMStudio retry timeout. Key architecture decisions made:

- Added test mode environment variable (LACE_TEST_MODE) that conditionally loads mock providers in production app.js
- Created /src/__tests__/utils/mock-provider.ts for CLI testing with predictable responses
- Fixed race conditions in E2E tests with better temp file naming
- All CLI conversation flow tests now use mock providers and complete in ~3 seconds vs timing out

The test suite is comprehensive with 1612 passing tests covering React components, provider integrations, tool systems, CLI flows, and conversation management. The mock provider approach allows testing complete CLI execution flows without external dependencies.
