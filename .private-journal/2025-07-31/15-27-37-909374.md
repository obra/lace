## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to investigate the rebase situation carefully before making changes. Key points:
1. Main branch has significant task tool changes
2. TaskCreateTool now allows multi-create (array schema)
3. Our branch's ToolResult fixes will conflict
4. Need to potentially split last two commits to isolate conflicting parts
5. Can't just merge - need to be thoughtful

I should examine:
- Current branch commits
- What main branch has changed
- Identify specific conflicts
- Plan how to preserve our UI work while adapting to new schemas
