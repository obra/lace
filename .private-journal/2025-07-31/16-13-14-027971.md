## Project Notes

Looking at the TypeScript linting errors that need to be fixed after implementing metadata support across all task tools. The main issues are:

1. `result.metadata?.task` is typed as `unknown` and needs proper casting in tests
2. Unsafe `any` usage in task renderer component at line 149: `const resultMetadata = (result as any).metadata;`

I need to fix these typing issues while maintaining the metadata functionality. The tests are passing (28/28) but linting is failing due to strict TypeScript rules about unknown types and any usage.

The pattern for fixing the test file is to cast unknown metadata types:
- `const taskData = result.metadata?.task as Task;` 
- `const tasksData = result.metadata?.tasks as Task[];`

For the renderer component, I need to properly type the result metadata instead of using `any`.
