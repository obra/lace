## Project Notes

Key conflicts identified between main and our branch:

**Main branch changes:**
1. TaskCreateTool schema changed from single task object to ARRAY of tasks: `tasks: z.array(...).min(1).max(20)`
2. TaskCreateTool completely rewritten with different implementation approach
3. Uses session-based TaskManager access: `context?.session?.getTaskManager()`
4. Much more comprehensive description with task sizing strategy
5. Handles bulk task creation with atomicity
6. Returns different messages for single vs multiple tasks
7. Removed old fallback persistence approach
8. Much cleaner implementation architecture

**Our branch changes:**
1. Added metadata to TaskCreateTool: `return this.createResult(message, { task });`
2. Kept old single-task schema
3. Kept fallback persistence approach
4. Has comprehensive metadata tests

**The conflict:**
- Main's new array schema is incompatible with our single-task metadata approach
- Main removed the fallback persistence code we still use
- Main's implementation is completely different architecture
- Our UI renderers expect single task in metadata.task, but main creates arrays

**What we need to preserve:**
1. The UI renderer work in packages/web/ (mostly compatible)
2. The metadata concept - `return this.createResult(message, { task });`  
3. The comprehensive tests for metadata structure
4. The plan document

**What needs adaptation:**
1. TaskCreateTool metadata needs to work with array schema
2. May need metadata.tasks (array) instead of metadata.task (single)
3. Tests need to adapt to new schema
4. UI renderers might need to handle both single and array cases
