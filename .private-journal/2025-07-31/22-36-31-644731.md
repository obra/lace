## Project Notes

Jesse has provided a comprehensive type cleanup implementation plan for the Lace project. This is a well-structured plan that addresses several architectural issues:

1. **Problem**: Type shadowing and duplication in packages/web/ - ThreadId and ApprovalDecision are redefined, causing confusion
2. **Problem**: 4 different import paths for same core types - creates maintenance nightmare
3. **Problem**: Thread validation logic duplicated instead of imported
4. **Problem**: Mixed concerns with API/UI/event types scattered

The plan is thorough with:
- Clear prerequisites and verification steps (test/lint/build before/after EVERY task)
- TDD approach with failing tests first
- Incremental migration in small batches
- Comprehensive rollback plan
- Manual verification checklist

Key architectural insights:
- Core types should come from single source (~/* paths)
- Web package should use @/* paths but import core types from unified location
- Branded types (ThreadId) need special handling in Zod schemas
- Client/server boundary enforcement critical for Next.js

The plan follows Jesse's strict rules:
- YAGNI principle
- Test-first development
- Zero `any` types
- Commit frequently with verification
- Clear separation of concerns

This looks like a solid plan that should clean up a significant technical debt issue while maintaining system stability through careful incremental changes and comprehensive testing.
