## Project Notes

## Task Metadata on Main Branch - Project Status

### Current Achievement
✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Task metadata now displays correctly in real-time
✅ **Rich UI Implementation**: Beautiful task completion/update renderers with design system
✅ **Full Test Coverage**: 674 tests passing including integration tests
✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript strict mode compliance
✅ **Lint Clean**: Zero ESLint warnings

### Branch Status: task-metadata-on-main
- 2 commits ahead of origin/task-metadata-on-main
- All changes focused on packages/web (no main project disruption)  
- Ready for merge once integration testing documented

### Files Modified
- `packages/web/components/timeline/tool/task.tsx` - Rich renderers with design system
- `packages/web/components/timeline/tool/types.ts` - Enhanced renderer interface  
- `packages/web/lib/server/session-service.ts` - Fixed event format consistency
- `packages/web/lib/timeline-converter.ts` - Enhanced metadata passing
- Multiple test files with comprehensive coverage

### Integration Test Results
1. **Real-time vs Persistence**: Events now use identical formats ✅
2. **Timeline Conversion**: Metadata properly preserved through conversion ✅  
3. **UI Rendering**: Rich task displays work in both scenarios ✅
4. **Fallback Graceful**: Missing metadata handled elegantly ✅

### Remaining Tasks
1. Documentation of integration testing approach
2. Final cleanup and commit organization
3. Merge preparation

### Next Steps
- Document the integration testing strategy we implemented
- Final review of all changes
- Prepare for merge to main

This represents a significant UX improvement - users now see immediate rich feedback for task operations instead of generic "Tool executed" messages.
