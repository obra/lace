## Project Notes

Successfully fixed all cascading type errors from updating ToolCallEventData interface. The main issue was that timeline-converter.ts was expecting a specific shape for toolData.result but needed to use the proper ToolResult type. Also fixed types/web.ts import issue by adding explicit type imports alongside re-exports.

All verification passes now:
- npm run build: ✓ 
- npm run lint: ✓ 
- npm run test:run: ✓ (691 tests passed, 2 skipped)

Key technical insight: TypeScript sometimes has trouble with re-exported types in interface definitions, so explicit imports alongside re-exports can resolve ambiguity. The pattern used was:
```typescript
// Re-export for external consumers
export type { ThreadId, ApprovalDecision, Task } from '@/lib/core';
// Import for internal usage in this file
import type { ThreadId, ApprovalDecision, Task } from '@/lib/core';
```

Ready to commit progress and continue with Task 2.3 (Create combined events file).
