## Project Notes

Jesse is showing me that the task metadata implementation is working in the web UI! This is great - it means our metadata flow is working correctly. However, there are some issues:

1. **Real-time vs Reload Behavior**: When tasks are first created, the UI doesn't show the task links ("View task" buttons), but after a reload they appear. This suggests there's a timing issue between when the TOOL_CALL event is processed and when the TOOL_RESULT with metadata becomes available.

2. **Event Processing**: Jesse mentions "when we get the tasks as events, we don't have the results" - this indicates that during real-time streaming, the timeline processor is trying to render the task before the tool result with metadata is available.

3. **Timeline Aggregation**: The issue is likely in how TOOL_CALL and TOOL_RESULT events are aggregated into TOOL_AGGREGATED events for the UI. The metadata from TOOL_RESULT needs to be properly passed through to the renderer.

This is exactly the kind of integration testing issue that would come up - the backend metadata is working, but the real-time event processing pipeline needs to handle the timing correctly.
