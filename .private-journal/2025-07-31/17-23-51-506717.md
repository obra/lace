## Project Notes

Interesting! Jesse created a task in real-time and there's no debug dump showing. This tells us something important:

Looking at the image, I can see:
1. "Created task" shows in the timeline
2. "Tool executed, no output returned" message
3. No debug dump visible
4. The task arguments are visible in the technical details

This suggests that either:
1. The renderResult function isn't being called at all during real-time
2. The task creation succeeded (no error) and found task data, so it didn't hit the debug dump fallback
3. The renderResult is being called but with different data than expected

The fact that we see "Tool executed, no output returned" is very telling - this suggests that either the TOOL_RESULT event doesn't have content, or the tool result is being processed differently than expected.

Since the task arguments are showing in the technical details, we know the TOOL_CALL event is working. But the lack of debug dump suggests the renderResult either isn't being called or is finding some task data (even if incorrect).
