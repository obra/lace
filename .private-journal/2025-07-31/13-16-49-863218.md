## Project Notes

The user is asking me to compare the content of docs/design/task-tool-metadata.md with what got integrated into docs/design/tools.md to see if anything was missed.

Looking at both files:

1. docs/design/task-tool-metadata.md - This was the standalone document I created earlier with comprehensive tool metadata architecture
2. docs/design/tools.md - This is the general tools guide that I updated to integrate the metadata content

I need to read through both and identify any content that exists in task-tool-metadata.md that didn't make it into tools.md.
