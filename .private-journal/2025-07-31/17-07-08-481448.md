## Project Notes

Ah! This is a crucial insight from Jesse. The React is clearly reprocessing because:

1. The "Show Details" area shows the updated tool arguments/data when events arrive in real-time
2. But the "View task" links only appear after reload
3. This means the TOOL_CALL arguments are flowing through correctly in real-time, but the TOOL_RESULT metadata is not

This suggests the issue is specifically in how the TOOL_RESULT metadata gets aggregated and passed to the task renderer during real-time streaming. The timeline converter's `processToolCallAggregation` function might not be properly updating existing TOOL_AGGREGATED events when TOOL_RESULT arrives later.

The key insight is that React IS reprocessing and the UI IS updating in real-time - just not the metadata part. This points to a specific issue in the metadata flow rather than a general real-time processing problem.
