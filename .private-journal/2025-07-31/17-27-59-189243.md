## Project Notes

Now I understand the issue! During real-time streaming:

1. TOOL_CALL arrives â†’ UI displays tool call
2. TOOL_RESULT arrives but either has no content or empty content
3. ToolCallDisplay sees no content and shows "Tool executed, no output returned"
4. renderResult() never gets called because there's no content to render

After reload:
1. Both TOOL_CALL and TOOL_RESULT are loaded from persistence
2. TOOL_RESULT has proper content and metadata
3. ToolCallDisplay calls renderResult() 
4. We get the debug dump and can see the metadata

The issue is in the condition that determines when to call renderResult. Let me find that logic in ToolCallDisplay.tsx.
