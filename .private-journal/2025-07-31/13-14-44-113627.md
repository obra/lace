## Project Notes

Reading through the conversation summary and implementation documents. I can see that:

1. The user asked to "clean up the ui of all the other task related tool renderers like we did for the task create tool"

2. I initially tried a UI-only approach with context-aware display names and enhanced renderResult methods, but the meaningful summaries weren't showing up because the task tools themselves only return plain text, not structured metadata

3. The user corrected me: "no. we do not fucking pattern match on the text. we use the metadata" and "the task metadata is there, but you're not using it"

4. We stepped back and documented the correct architecture - tools should provide complete Task objects in their metadata at event-time

5. I created comprehensive documentation in docs/design/tools.md and an implementation plan in docs/plans/2025-07-31/task-tool-cleanup.md with 9 tasks

Looking at the current task tools in src/tools/implementations/task-manager/tools.ts, I can see that:
- TaskCreateTool already returns { task } in metadata on line 77 and 103
- Other tools (TaskListTool, TaskCompleteTool, TaskUpdateTool, TaskAddNoteTool, TaskViewTool) do NOT return structured metadata

The issue is clear: only TaskCreateTool has the metadata, the other tools need to be updated to follow the same pattern.

According to the implementation plan, I should start with Task 1, but TaskCreateTool already has metadata. So I should move to Task 2: Add Metadata to TaskUpdateTool, then continue through the other tools.

Let me check what the current todo list status is - it shows all UI work is completed, but the real issue is that the backend tools need to provide the metadata.
