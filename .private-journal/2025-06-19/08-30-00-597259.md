## Project Notes

Understanding Lace CLI Architecture for Slash Command System:

**Current Slash Command Implementation:**
- Both CLIInterface (readline-based) and TerminalInterface (Ink-based) have handleSlashCommand methods
- Currently supports: /compact, /help, /exit
- Commands are handled in the interactive loop after checking if input starts with "/"
- Both interfaces duplicate the slash command logic

**CLI Architecture Overview:**
1. **Entry Point**: src/cli.ts - orchestrates everything
2. **Interface Layer**: Two implementations:
   - CLIInterface (src/cli/interface.ts) - traditional readline
   - TerminalInterface (src/interfaces/terminal/terminal-interface.tsx) - Ink React-based
3. **Arguments**: src/cli/args.ts - Commander-based CLI parsing
4. **Configuration**: src/config/lace-dir.ts - ~/.lace directory management

**Current User Input Flow:**
1. CLI args parsed in cli/args.ts using Commander
2. Interface selected based on --ui flag (readline vs terminal)  
3. Interactive loop in startInteractive() methods
4. Input checked for slash commands before sending to Agent
5. handleSlashCommand() methods handle command routing

**Key Findings:**
- Slash commands are interface-level, not CLI-level commands
- No centralized command registry or system
- Code duplication between the two interfaces
- Simple switch-case based command handling
- No plugin or extensible command architecture
- Commands are synchronous operations on threadManager

**Testing Coverage:**
- Comprehensive tests for slash commands in src/cli/__tests__/interface.test.ts
- Tests cover /compact, /help, unknown commands
- No tests for terminal interface slash commands (only CLI interface)

**Configuration Structure:**
- ~/.lace directory for user config
- No slash command configuration files
- System and user prompts configurable
- Environment variables for API keys and settings
