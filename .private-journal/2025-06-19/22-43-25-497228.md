## Project Notes

Successfully completed Phase 1 of terminal messages redesign. Key accomplishments:

- ✅ Event-based rendering system with specialized components
- ✅ Tool execution display with unified call+result view
- ✅ Smart JSON formatting (compact for simple objects)
- ✅ Clean user/assistant formatting with inline prefixes
- ✅ Fixed thinking blocks duplication bug
- ✅ CollapsibleBox UI component for debugging details
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for code blocks and JSON

Architecture is now solid foundation for future phases. Event system properly separates concerns between persistent ThreadEvents and ephemeral UI messages.
