## Project Notes

Need to review the parallel agents' work systematically to ensure no type safety regressions were introduced. The user wants me to check for any "fuckups" in the type changes before committing. This is critical because we had 8 agents working in parallel on different ESLint error categories, and they could have made conflicting or incorrect changes.

Key areas to check:
1. Agent type casting and interfaces - did agents use proper type assertions vs any?
2. Method signature changes - did agents incorrectly change sync/async methods?
3. Import/export changes - were any critical imports/exports broken?
4. Mock implementations in tests - are mocks still compatible with real interfaces?
5. Tool implementations - are the Zod schemas and validation still correct?

I should spot-check the major changes each agent made and ensure type consistency.
