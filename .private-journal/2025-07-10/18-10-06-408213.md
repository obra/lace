## Project Notes

Completed comprehensive analysis of Lace codebase architecture for web interface integration. Key findings:

## Architecture Analysis Complete

### Interface System (src/interfaces/)
- **Terminal Interface**: React/Ink-based rich TUI with sophisticated event handling
- **Non-Interactive Interface**: Simple console-based interface for --prompt flag
- **StreamingTimelineProcessor**: O(1) incremental event processing with React integration
- **Pattern**: Clean separation between interface logic and agent processing

### Event System Architecture
- **Event-Driven Core**: Agent extends EventEmitter with 20+ event types
- **Real-time Events**: agent_token, tool_call_start/complete, state_change, etc.
- **Thread Events**: USER_MESSAGE, AGENT_MESSAGE, TOOL_CALL, TOOL_RESULT, etc.
- **Event Flow**: User Input → Events → Agent Processing → Provider API → Tool Execution → Response
- **Timeline Processing**: Dual-path with cached ThreadEvents + real-time streaming

### Threading/Persistence Layer
- **SQLite-based**: DatabasePersistence with graceful degradation to memory-only
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable event sequences for conversation reconstruction
- **Thread Management**: Stateless design - can rebuild from events
- **Compaction**: Automatic summarization when token limits approached

### Provider System
- **Abstract Base**: AIProvider with normalized interfaces
- **Multi-Provider**: Anthropic, OpenAI, LMStudio, Ollama support
- **Registry System**: Auto-discovery of providers
- **Format Conversion**: Generic ProviderMessage[] ↔ provider-specific APIs

### Build System
- **TypeScript**: ES2023 target with Node16 modules
- **React Support**: TSX compilation with React.createElement
- **Path Aliases**: ~/\* for clean imports
- **Build Process**: tsc + tsc-alias + prompt copying

### Web-Related Code
- **HTTP Tools**: url-fetch tool for web content retrieval
- **HAR Recording**: HTTP Archive format for debugging
- **No Web Interface**: Currently only terminal and non-interactive interfaces

## Key Integration Points for Web Interface

1. **Event System**: Already designed for multiple interfaces
2. **StreamingTimelineProcessor**: O(1) event processing ready for WebSocket streaming
3. **Provider Abstraction**: Clean separation from interface concerns
4. **Thread Management**: Stateless, event-sourced design perfect for web
5. **Tool System**: Model-agnostic with approval workflow

The architecture is exceptionally well-designed for web interface integration with clear separation of concerns and event-driven communication patterns.
