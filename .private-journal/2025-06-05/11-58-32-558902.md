## Project Notes

Completed Task 6 of the logging implementation spec: Tool Call Activity Logging. 

Successfully added activity logging to both:

1. **tool-approval.js**: Added logging for `tool_approval_request` and `tool_approval_decision` events
   - Logs requests with tool, method, params, and risk level
   - Logs decisions with approval status, modified params, and user decision type
   - Covers all decision paths: auto-approve, auto-deny, interactive choices (approve, modify, deny, stop, etc.)

2. **tool-registry.js**: Added logging for `tool_execution_start` and `tool_execution_complete` events  
   - Logs execution start with tool, method, and params
   - Logs execution completion with success status, result, timing, and error info
   - Uses try/finally to ensure completion event is always logged

**Integration changes:**
- Updated Lace.js to create ActivityLogger first and pass to all components
- Modified Console.js to accept activityLogger as constructor option
- Updated Agent.js to pass sessionId to tool execution calls
- All components now share the same ActivityLogger instance

**Key design decisions:**
- Used sessionId parameter threading to connect approval and execution events
- Added comprehensive error handling to avoid breaking normal operation  
- Structured event data according to spec requirements
- Used descriptive user_decision values for different approval scenarios

Tests are passing (except one unrelated database test), indicating the changes don't break existing functionality.

Next tasks would be Task 7 (Model Provider Session ID Tracking) and Task 8 (Integration and Testing).
