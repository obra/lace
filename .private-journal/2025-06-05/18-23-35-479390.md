## Project Notes

Stage 13 "Connect to Lace Backend" completed successfully:

**What was implemented:**

- Real agent response handling through LaceUI.handleMessage()
- Live streaming token display with real-time callback system
- Agent activity tracking and display in conversation
- Token usage and model name display in status bar
- Error handling for agent failures and aborts
- Backend integration tests (11 tests, all passing)

**Key files modified:**

- `src/ui/App.tsx`: Added laceUI prop, real message handling, streaming integration
- `src/ui/lace-ui.ts`: Added UI callback setup for streaming tokens
- `src/ui/lace-cli.js`: CLI entry point with TypeScript imports

**Architecture:**

- LaceUI class acts as bridge between lace backend and Ink UI
- App component receives LaceUI instance as prop
- Streaming handled via useRef and callback system
- All backend components (Agent, ToolRegistry, etc.) properly mocked in tests

**Testing status:**

- All existing tests passing (128 total)
- Stage 13 integration tests: 11/11 passing
- Comprehensive coverage of streaming, errors, concurrency

**Next potential steps:**

- Package.json script updates for lace-ink CLI
- Real integration testing with live API calls
- Performance optimization for large conversations
