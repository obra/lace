## Project Notes

Successfully completed Task 8: Integration and Testing - the final task of the dual logging system implementation!

**What was accomplished:**

1. **Debug Logger Integration**: Added DebugLogger initialization in Agent constructor from CLI args, replacing 9 console.log calls with appropriate debug levels (debug/info/warn)

2. **Logger Propagation**: Ensured both activity and debug loggers are passed to all subagents and components, maintaining consistency across the agent hierarchy

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created 7 integration tests covering:

   - Debug logger initialization from CLI args
   - Independent operation of both logging systems
   - Graceful handling of failures in either system
   - Subagent logger inheritance
   - Performance impact verification

4. **Error Handling**: Verified that failures in one logging system don't affect the other - activity logging failures don't break debug logging and vice versa

**Key technical decisions:**

- Used appropriate log levels: debug for verbose output, info for important status, warn for errors
- Maintained backwards compatibility with existing verbose flag
- Ensured subagents inherit correct debug logging configuration
- Added proper error isolation between logging systems

**Test Results:**

- All 7 new integration tests passing
- Dual logging systems work independently without interference
- Performance overhead is minimal (< 200ms)
- Graceful degradation when logging fails

The entire dual logging system implementation is now complete with Tasks 1-8 all finished. The system provides both always-on SQLite activity logging for forensic audit trails and configurable debug logging for development, exactly as specified in the original requirements.
