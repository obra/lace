## Project Notes

Stage 14 "Diff Highlighting" completed successfully:

**What was implemented:**

- Unified diff format highlighting with red deletions, green additions
- Integration with existing ```diff code block syntax
- ANSI terminal color codes for proper terminal display
- Graceful fallback for malformed diff content

**Key files created/modified:**

- `src/ui/utils/diff-highlight.ts`: New utility for diff parsing and coloring
- `src/ui/utils/syntax-highlight.ts`: Extended to handle 'diff' language specially
- `test/ui/integration/step14-diff-highlighting.test.tsx`: 10 comprehensive tests

**Features delivered:**

- Green highlighting for addition lines (+)
- Red highlighting for deletion lines (-)
- Preserved formatting for headers (---, +++, @@) and context lines
- Support for multiple diff blocks in single message
- Error handling for invalid diff content

**Testing status:**

- All 10 new diff highlighting tests passing
- Total test count: 138 tests (no regressions)
- Comprehensive coverage: simple diffs, mixed changes, headers, indentation, edge cases

**Next potential work:**

- Stage 15: Performance optimization for large conversations
- Advanced diff features: side-by-side view, file tree navigation
- Integration with real tool outputs that contain file changes
