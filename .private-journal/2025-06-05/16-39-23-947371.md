## Project Notes

Tasks 2 & 3 Complete: Foundation Layer Done

✅ TaskTool (Task 2):
- All 4 methods implemented with proper agent context
- 32 unit tests covering methods, errors, integration
- Integrated with ToolRegistry and Agent execution flow

✅ ProgressTracker (Task 3):  
- Lightweight in-memory progress tracking system
- 32 unit tests + 8 integration tests
- No conversation context pollution
- Automatic cleanup and memory management
- Real-time callback system for UI updates

Next: Task 1 - Parallel tool execution (core enhancement)
This is the big architectural change - replacing sequential tool execution with Promise.all() parallel execution.
