## Project Notes

The integration test is failing because:
1. MockFileReadTool doesn't extend the Tool base class properly
2. ToolExecutor.registerTool() expects a specific interface
3. The mock tool registration isn't working, so executeTool() can't find it
4. This prevents the test from reaching the approval system logic

From the ToolExecutor test files, I can see the correct pattern:
- Tools should extend Tool base class
- They need proper schema validation 
- They need to be registered with the correct name

The test successfully identified the root cause though - it's not an approval system issue, it's a tool registration issue.
