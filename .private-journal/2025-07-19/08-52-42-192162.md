## Project Notes

SessionService Cleanup Project - COMPLETED ✅

**Final Architecture State:**
- SessionService now focused on web-specific concerns: caching, SSE event handlers, approval callbacks
- Routes call core Session methods directly: session.getEffectiveConfiguration(), session.updateConfiguration(), session.spawnAgent()
- Eliminated 3 duplicate methods: getProjectForSession(), getEffectiveConfiguration(), updateSessionConfiguration()
- All 322 tests passing after systematic fixes

**Key Files Modified:**
- `packages/web/lib/server/session-service.ts` - Removed duplicate methods, retained caching
- Configuration route tests - Converted from mocked unit tests to real integration tests
- Multiple API route tests - Updated to call session methods directly

**Test Strategy Success:**
- TDD methodology with Red-Green-Refactor prevented breaking changes
- Integration tests proved more reliable than complex mocking
- Systematic test fixing (29 failures → 0) through categorized approach

**Architectural Lessons:**
- Service layer should handle cross-cutting concerns (caching, events), not duplicate business logic
- Direct calls to core classes reduce indirection and maintenance overhead
- SessionService.getSession() provides the perfect balance of caching with direct method access
