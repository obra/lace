## Project Notes

Reading through the design system import plan for f-integrate-spicy-web. This is a massive, well-structured plan to import a sophisticated design system from f-web-spicy into the monorepo. Key points:

1. 24 detailed steps across 8 phases
2. Must preserve existing application functionality 
3. All commits from f-web-spicy content must use --author "Jason Shellen <jason@shellen.com>"
4. Moving existing components to old/ namespace first
5. Importing 35+ UI components, Storybook 9 setup, complete infrastructure
6. Very thorough with verification steps and troubleshooting

The plan looks legitimate and well thought out. It's preserving existing functionality while importing a comprehensive design system. This appears to be internal company work moving components between projects.
