## Project Notes

The tool approval flow is broken because there are two different approval patterns:

**Pattern 1: Direct ToolExecutor callback (what's expected)**
- ToolExecutor.setApprovalCallback() with ApprovalCallback interface
- ToolExecutor calls callback.requestApproval() directly
- This is synchronous from ToolExecutor's perspective

**Pattern 2: Agent event emission (what web app expects)**  
- Agent emits approval_request events
- External listeners handle these events
- Web app listens for these events in setupAgentApprovals()

The problem: Pattern 2 requires Pattern 1 to work first! The Agent can only emit approval_request events if the ToolExecutor has been given a callback that triggers the approval flow.

The fix: Create a bridge callback that connects ToolExecutor to Agent events, then let the web app listen for those events.
