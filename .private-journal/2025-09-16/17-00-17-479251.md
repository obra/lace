## Project Notes

## Config Management Pattern Clarification

Found that Lace uses two separate config files:
1. `~/.lace/user-settings.json` - UI preferences via UserSettingsManager (theme, timeline width, etc.)
2. `~/.lace/config.json` - System config via GlobalConfigManager (default AI models)

Both managers handle their own file I/O directly. The web layer just calls them through API routes.

So we don't need a separate GlobalConfigService - we can just call GlobalConfigManager directly from the API route, just like how api.settings.ts calls UserSettingsManager directly.

Pattern is:
- API route calls the manager directly
- Manager handles all file I/O
- Web UI calls the API route
