## Project Notes

## Default Models UI Configuration Research

Found the key pieces:
1. GlobalConfigManager reads from ~/.lace/config.json
2. Currently NO UI for editing the global config - it's file-based only
3. Settings UI has panels for Providers, MCP, UI, User
4. Provider panel manages provider instances but NOT default models
5. ModelSelector component knows how to select provider:model combos
6. No existing API routes for global config management

The defaultModels config expects format like:
- fast: "provider-instance-id:model-id"  
- smart: "provider-instance-id:model-id"

Architecture needs:
- New API route for reading/writing global config
- New settings panel or integration into existing panel
- Method to update the config.json file safely
- Consider caching invalidation in GlobalConfigManager
