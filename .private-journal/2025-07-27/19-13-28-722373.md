## Project Notes

I'm continuing the tool approval race condition fix implementation. I've successfully fixed the main architectural violations in the web APIs, but Jesse found more ThreadManager references in the web package that need to be addressed.

Key findings from reading the test files:
1. The pending approvals API test looks clean - it properly mocks Agent.getPendingApprovals() and doesn't directly access ThreadManager
2. The approval route test also looks clean - it properly mocks Agent.handleApprovalResponse() and follows proper architectural boundaries
3. The route implementations are now using the Agent interface correctly

But Jesse's concern is about "a ton of threadmanager references in the web interface still" so I need to systematically find and address any remaining violations. I've already fixed the main API routes, but there might be other files that still have improper ThreadManager access.

The current task 3c is "Fix remaining web API ThreadManager references" and it's marked as in_progress, so I need to continue working on this before moving to task 4 (agent-level duplicate execution guards).

Looking at the files I've reviewed so far, the test files appear to be properly architected - they're testing the web layer's interaction with the Agent interface, not directly accessing ThreadManager. This is appropriate since tests should verify the contract being tested.

I should search more systematically for remaining ThreadManager references in the web package to understand what Jesse is seeing.
