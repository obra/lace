## Project Notes

Current state of the Lace codebase regarding tool execution race condition:

**What's been implemented (from plan document):**
- Architectural improvements to tool execution flow
- Agent no longer creates TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST events directly
- EventApprovalCallback owns approval request creation
- Proper separation of concerns restored

**What's missing (causing the live issue):**
- Database-level race condition prevention for duplicate tool executions
- Unique constraints to prevent multiple TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE events for same tool call ID
- Atomic operations in approval workflow to prevent simultaneous processing

**Evidence of the problem:**
- Logs show two POST requests to approval endpoint 2ms apart
- Anthropic API error: "each tool_use must have a single result. Found multiple tool_result blocks with id: toolu_01Tmw3q38djbBdRo1k81kegC"
- This is the exact dangerous race condition that can cause double file writes and API errors

**Next steps:**
1. Examine database schema for unique constraints on tool approval events
2. Implement atomic operations in approval workflow
3. Add database-level prevention of duplicate tool executions
4. Test race condition scenarios
