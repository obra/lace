## Project Notes

I'm continuing from a critical production bug fix - tool approval race conditions were causing dangerous duplicate tool execution. Jesse and I have been implementing defense-in-depth with 4 layers:

1. Database unique constraints (âœ… DONE)
2. Atomic operations in ThreadManager (âœ… DONE)  
3. Agent interface fixes and proper architectural boundaries (âœ… DONE)
4. Agent-level duplicate execution guards (ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS)

Current status on Task 4: I was implementing duplicate execution prevention in Agent._handleToolApprovalResponse() method. The logic checks if a TOOL_RESULT already exists for the toolCallId before executing - if it does, log warning and return early.

I had started writing tests but encountered error: `ReferenceError: createMockTool is not defined`. Looking at the EventApprovalCallback test file, I can see they use `new BashTool()` directly instead of mock functions.

The key insight: this codebase prefers real components over mocks. The tests use real BashTool, real ThreadManager, real database (in-memory SQLite). This is consistent with CLAUDE.md philosophy: "Never mock functionality under test - use real components".

For Task 4 tests, I should:
1. Use real BashTool instead of trying to create mock tools
2. Follow the pattern from event-approval-callback.test.ts
3. Create real tool calls with real tool IDs
4. Use the MockProviderWithToolCalls pattern for controlled responses

Need to get Task 4 working first, then move to Task 5 (conversation builder deduplication) and Task 6 (integration tests).
