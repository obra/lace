## Project Notes

Just read Jesse's comprehensive plan for fixing tool approval race conditions in Lace. This is a critical production safety issue where users can rapidly click approval buttons causing duplicate tool execution.

The plan shows excellent engineering discipline:
- Defense-in-depth approach with 4 layers: database constraints, atomic operations, API error handling, and agent guards
- Database unique constraint on (thread_id, type, toolCallId) for TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE events  
- Making ThreadManager.addEvent() atomic with database transactions
- Making the approval API idempotent by gracefully handling constraint violations
- Agent-level guards to prevent duplicate execution even if duplicate events exist
- Conversation builder deduplication for clean provider API calls

Key technical insights:
- SQLite unique constraint with json_extract on data field is elegant
- Transaction-based atomicity prevents memory/database inconsistency
- Idempotent API design (return success for duplicates) is correct approach
- Multiple defense layers ensure safety even if one layer fails

Testing strategy is solid:
- Real components, no mocking functionality under test
- Actual concurrency testing with Promise.all()
- End-to-end workflows with real agents
- Manual testing guidelines

The plan is ready for implementation and addresses a real production safety issue. Shows good understanding of concurrent systems and database consistency.
