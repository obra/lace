## Project Notes

Working on the f/event-driven-tools branch in the no-tool-dismiss worktree. The race condition defense system is fully implemented and working, but we discovered the tool approval system itself is broken for multi-tool scenarios.

Key files involved in the current debugging:
- src/agents/agent.ts - contains _handleToolApprovalResponse method that needs debugging
- Multi-tool test scenarios that show only first tool executes after approval

The user emphasized this is critical: "tools appear broken" - so this needs to be fixed immediately to restore tool functionality.
