## Project Notes

Current status: Task 6 (integration tests) in progress. Tests are failing as expected in TDD red phase, revealing integration issues between defense layers:

**Failing Tests Analysis:**
- Tool executed 6 times instead of 1 (agent guards not working)
- 50 approval responses instead of 1 (database constraints not working) 
- Conversation builder msg.content.some error

**Root Cause Investigation Needed:**
1. Database constraint verification - is it actually applied?
2. Agent handleApprovalResponse flow - is it being called properly?
3. EventApprovalCallback integration - how does it connect to Agent?
4. Conversation builder tool result processing

**Files to Debug:**
- `src/agents/tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts` (failing tests)
- `src/persistence/database.ts` (constraint implementation)
- `src/agents/agent.ts` (duplicate guards)
- `src/threads/conversation-builder.ts` (tool result handling)

These integration failures are exactly what TDD is supposed to catch - the defense layers work individually but not together. Need to debug each layer systematically.
