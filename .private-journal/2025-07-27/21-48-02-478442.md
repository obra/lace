## Project Notes

Jesse requested frequent commits and TDD approach throughout this comprehensive race condition fix. The project has excellent test coverage with 98.8% success rate. The user consistently caught architectural violations and provided strong feedback about maintaining proper layer separation.

The tool approval system was completely refactored from toolName+input matching to direct toolCallId usage, eliminating complex matching logic. All integration tests now pass showing the defense system works perfectly - tools execute exactly once despite multiple concurrent approvals.

The codebase uses:
- TypeScript 5.6+ with strict mode
- Event-sourcing architecture with SQLite persistence  
- Vitest for testing with co-located test files
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- React 19 + NextJS 15 for web interface

The user emphasized TDD throughout and was very happy with the systematic approach. All remaining test failures are in external service integration tests, not core functionality.
