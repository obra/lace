## Project Notes

## Tool Approval Dialog Fix - Status Update

I've successfully implemented the fix for the tool approval dialog not showing in the web UI. Here's what was done:

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that the `ToolExecutor` wasn't configured with an approval callback, causing it to skip approval checks at line 91 in executor.ts where it checks `if (this.approvalCallback)`.

### Implemented Solutions

1. **Added TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST event type** to the SessionEvent union in `types/api.ts` - ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Added ApprovalCallback import** to `lace-imports.ts` - ✅ COMPLETED  
3. **Set up approval callbacks in session service** - ✅ COMPLETED
   - Main agent approval callback at lines 74-97
   - Delegate agent approval callback at lines 179-202
   - Both callbacks integrate with the existing approval manager
4. **Fixed parameter destructuring bug** in the approval_request event handler - ✅ COMPLETED

### Technical Details
- The approval callback connects `ToolExecutor` to `ApprovalManager`
- When tools need approval, they now properly request it through the UI
- The callback extracts tool metadata (description, annotations, isReadOnly) and passes it to the approval manager
- The approval manager sends SSE events to the UI to show the approval dialog
- The existing `ToolApprovalModal` component should now receive and display approval requests

### Build Status
- Main project builds successfully without TypeScript errors
- Web package has minor linting warnings but compiles successfully
- The approval flow should now work correctly

The fix is complete and the tool approval dialog should now appear in the web UI when tools need approval, instead of auto-approving them.
