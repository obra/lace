## Project Notes

Key insight: The real issue is that when sessions are loaded from the database, the child agents (delegates) aren't being loaded. This is why:
1. Sessions show up in the list but have no agents
2. Agent names appear generic instead of their actual names
3. The persistence tests fail because agents aren't being reconstructed

The Session.getById() method was supposed to handle this by finding delegate threads and reconstructing agents from them, but I simplified it to return null. I need to properly implement session reconstruction that loads all child agents.
