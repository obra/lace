## Project Notes

Current issue: Session.getById() only reconstructs the session agent but doesn't load the child agents (delegates) that were spawned within that session. This means persisted sessions appear empty in the UI.

Key insight: Child agents are created via createDelegateAgent() and would have been persisted as separate threads. I need to:
1. Find all delegate threads that belong to this session
2. Reconstruct those agents and add them to the session's _agents map
3. Make sure the session properly shows these agents in getAgents()

The ThreadManager has getAllThreadsWithMetadata() which should help find child threads. I need to identify child threads somehow - maybe by parentThreadId or some other metadata.
