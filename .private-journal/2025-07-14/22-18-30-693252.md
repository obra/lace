## Project Notes

Key insight: Less mocking, more real code. The current test failures are due to mocks not matching the real implementation, not actual code issues. Need to:

1. Remove excessive mocking from web UI tests
2. Let the real Session, Agent, and ThreadManager classes run
3. Fix actual issues that surface instead of papering over them with mocks
4. Only mock external dependencies (like API keys, file system, etc.)

This aligns with the TDD principle - tests should test real behavior, not mocked behavior.
