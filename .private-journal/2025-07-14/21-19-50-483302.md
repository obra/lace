## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to create a Session class instead of adding session methods to Agent. This makes architectural sense:

- Session class manages multiple agents and session-level operations
- Agent class focuses on individual conversation threads
- Clean separation of concerns
- Session can handle spawning agents, managing session metadata, etc.

I should:
1. Create a new Session class in src/sessions/
2. Remove the session methods I just added to Agent
3. Update SessionService to use the Session class
4. Make Session handle the database operations through ThreadManager appropriately

This will be much cleaner than having Agent handle session management.
