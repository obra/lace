## Project Notes

Reading the threads.md design doc clarifies the architecture:

1. **Agent Layer** - Uses threads to build conversations
2. **ThreadManager** - High-level thread operations  
3. **ThreadPersistence** - SQLite storage with migrations
4. **Event Storage** - Immutable event sequences

The Agent should NOT expose ThreadManager methods directly to the SessionService. Instead, the Agent should handle its own thread operations internally and expose appropriate session-level abstractions.

The SessionService should work with concepts like:
- Creating sessions (which are threads with session metadata)
- Listing sessions 
- Getting session details
- Spawning agents within sessions

But it shouldn't be manipulating threads directly through the Agent's ThreadManager. The Agent should encapsulate all thread operations.

Looking at the ThreadManager API in the docs:
- `createThread(threadId: string): Thread`
- `addEvent(threadId: string, type: EventType, data: any): ThreadEvent`
- `getEvents(threadId: string): ThreadEvent[]`
- `createCompactedVersion(reason: string): Promise<string>`
- `getCanonicalId(threadId: string): string`

The Agent should be the only one calling these methods. The SessionService should work at a higher level of abstraction.

I need to rethink the Agent's session management API to be more focused on session concepts rather than exposing thread operations directly.
