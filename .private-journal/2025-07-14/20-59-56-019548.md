## Project Notes

## Test Fixes Complete - Summary

Successfully fixed all failing tests after implementing the fail-safe ToolExecutor changes. Here's what was done:

### Test Updates Made:
1. **ToolExecutor Tests** (`src/tools/executor.test.ts`):
   - Added `ApprovalCallback` import
   - Created `autoApprovalCallback` that returns `Promise.resolve(ApprovalDecision.ALLOW_ONCE)`
   - Applied callback to all test cases so tools can execute
   - All 3 tests now pass

2. **Agent Tests** (`src/agents/__tests__/agent.test.ts`):
   - Added `ApprovalCallback` import
   - Created auto-approval callback in `beforeEach`
   - Applied callback to main `toolExecutor` instance
   - Applied callback to additional `toolExecutor` instances in specific tests
   - All 42 tests now pass

3. **Tool Approval Integration Tests** (`src/__tests__/tool-approval-integration.test.ts`):
   - Updated test name from "should execute tool without approval when no callback is set" to "should fail safely when no approval callback is set"
   - Changed expectation from `expect(result.isError).toBe(false)` to `expect(result.isError).toBe(true)`
   - Updated expected error message to match the new fail-safe behavior
   - All 12 tests now pass

### Key Technical Details:
- Used `() => Promise.resolve(ApprovalDecision.ALLOW_ONCE)` instead of `async () => ApprovalDecision.ALLOW_ONCE` to avoid ESLint `require-await` warnings
- The auto-approval callback allows tests to focus on their core functionality while respecting the new security model
- One test specifically validates the new fail-safe behavior, ensuring tools are blocked when no approval callback is configured

### Build Status:
- All modified tests pass (57/57)
- Main project builds successfully with no TypeScript errors
- The new security-first approach is fully validated by tests

The changes maintain backward compatibility for legitimate use cases while preventing accidental tool execution without approval systems in place.
