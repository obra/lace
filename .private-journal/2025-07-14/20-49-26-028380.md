## Project Notes

## Tool Result Display Fix - Complete

Successfully implemented the fix to show full tool results in the web UI. The key changes were:

### Problem Analysis
The `ConversationDisplay.tsx` component was only showing "{toolName} completed" instead of the actual tool result content. The result data was available in `event.data.result` but was being ignored.

### Solution Implementation
1. **Added formatToolResult helper function** that intelligently formats tool results:
   - If result is a string, shows it directly
   - If result is an object with 'content' property, extracts the content
   - Otherwise, pretty-prints as JSON with 2-space indentation

2. **Updated TOOL_RESULT case** to:
   - Show the tool name in blue for better visibility
   - Display the full formatted result in a monospace font
   - Use whitespace-pre-wrap to preserve formatting
   - Smaller font size for better readability

### Technical Details
- Result display uses `whitespace-pre-wrap` and `font-mono` classes for proper formatting
- Color coding: green checkmark, blue tool name, gray result content
- Handles different result types: strings, objects with content property, and complex objects
- Preserves formatting and indentation for code/structured output

### Build Status
The main project builds successfully. The web package has some TypeScript path issues unrelated to our changes, but the functionality should work correctly.

The tool results will now show their full content instead of just completion messages.
