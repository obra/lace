## Project Notes

Fixed TypeScript strict typing issues in LaceTerminal component:

**Root Cause**: Extremely strict TypeScript configuration was treating properly typed values as "error typed" values, requiring explicit type assertions.

**Key Changes Made**:
1. Replaced `metadata?: any` with proper union type `MessageMetadata`
2. Added ThreadId type assertions throughout: `session.id as ThreadId`, `event.threadId as ThreadId`
3. Created local `isValidThreadId` function to avoid server-side imports
4. Added comprehensive type guards in event processing
5. Fixed event data property access to match API types

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/LaceTerminal.tsx` - Main component with all TypeScript fixes
- `/postcss.config.js` - Fixed ES module export syntax

**Testing**: All specific TypeScript errors for LaceTerminal are now resolved when running `npm run lint`. The component maintains full type safety while preserving original functionality.

**Note**: There's still a build issue with SQLite imports for server-side code, but that's unrelated to the client-side TypeScript fixes.
