## Project Notes

Found the tool result display issue in the web UI. Two components handle tool results but neither shows the full content:

1. `ConversationDisplay.tsx` lines 134-143: Shows only generic "Tool Result: {toolName} completed" message
2. `LaceTerminal.tsx` lines 86-94: Shows `JSON.stringify(event.data.result || event.data, null, 2)` which is better but still might not be ideal

The issue is that `ConversationDisplay` completely ignores the actual tool result data, while `LaceTerminal` shows it as JSON. The user wants to see the full tool result content instead of what's currently shown.

Both components receive `ToolResultEventData` which contains:
- `toolName: string`
- `result: unknown`

The real tool result data is in `event.data.result` but ConversationDisplay completely ignores it.
