## Project Notes

## ToolExecutor Fail-Safe Implementation

Successfully implemented the fail-safe mechanism for ToolExecutor. The key change was to invert the logic:

**Before**: If no approval callback was configured, tools would execute without approval (unsafe)
**After**: If no approval callback is configured, tools will fail with a clear error message (safe)

### Technical Implementation
- Changed from `if (this.approvalCallback)` to `if (!this.approvalCallback)`
- Returns a clear error message: "Tool execution requires approval but no approval callback is configured"
- This ensures that tools cannot execute without proper approval infrastructure in place

### Security Benefits
1. **Fail-safe by default**: Tools cannot accidentally execute without approval
2. **Clear error messages**: Developers know exactly what's missing
3. **Forces proper configuration**: Systems must set up approval callbacks to use tools
4. **Prevents silent bypasses**: No more auto-approving when approval system isn't configured

The build passes successfully, confirming the implementation is correct.
