## Project Notes

Looking at the session-service.ts file, I can see that the approval callback setup is already implemented at lines 74-97 and lines 179-202. This is good - the key fix is already in place.

However, I notice there's a bug in the approval_request event handler at lines 336-393. The issue is that the `_requestId` parameter is being destructured but the actual parameter name is `requestId`. This would cause undefined behavior.

The real issue now is that the `ApprovalCallback` import is missing from the lace-imports.ts file, which is causing a TypeScript error. I need to add that import to complete the fix.
