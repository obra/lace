## Project Notes

The web package has a critical client/server boundary issue where client-side code is trying to import the lace backend. This is causing the Next.js dev server to fail because backend dependencies like sqlite can't run in the browser. Need to do a comprehensive review of all imports and ensure proper architectural boundaries are enforced.
