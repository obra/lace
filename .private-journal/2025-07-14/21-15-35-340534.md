## Project Notes

The linting errors are primarily in the session-service.ts file where I'm using any types for the ThreadManager and other components. This is causing unsafe assignment errors. I need to fix these TypeScript issues before we can properly add E2E tests.

The main issue is that I'm using `any` types and unsafe assignments throughout the session service, particularly when working with ThreadManager and agent components. This is happening because of the mocking approach and the way I'm dynamically requiring modules.

I should prioritize fixing the TypeScript errors first before continuing with E2E tests, as the linting errors indicate real type safety issues that need to be addressed.
