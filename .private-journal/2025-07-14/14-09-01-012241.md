## Project Notes

The TypeScript errors I found in the route.ts file are:

1. Line 66: Parameter 'error' implicitly has an 'any' type in the catch block
2. Module resolution issues with path aliases (but these are likely Next.js configuration issues, not the actual type safety issues requested)

The main type safety issues mentioned in the request are likely:
- Unsafe assignment of error typed values
- Unsafe calls on error typed values  
- Unsafe member access on error typed values
- Unsafe return of any value
- Unsafe arguments to functions

Looking at the code, the main issue is in the catch block where `error` is implicitly `any` and we're accessing `error.message` without proper type checking.
