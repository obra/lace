## Project Notes

Key insight: Session reconstruction needs to mirror the full agent lifecycle, not just creation. This includes:
1. Creating the session agent
2. Starting the session agent 
3. Creating delegate agents
4. Starting delegate agents

The SessionService.spawnAgent method shows the correct pattern - it creates agents AND starts them.
