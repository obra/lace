## Project Notes

Settings page context preservation issue:
- Currently settings pages don't have the sidebar
- We need to preserve project/session/agent context when navigating to settings
- Options:
  1. Add sidebar to SettingsLayout
  2. Pass context through URL params or state
  3. Create a shared layout wrapper that includes sidebar
- The sidebar needs to know the current context to highlight active items
- Users should be able to navigate back to their project/session/agent from settings
