## Project Notes

Jesse makes a good point about the build process - Bun bundles files into a virtual filesystem, so file modification timestamps won't be available at runtime. 

Option C (embedded version in markdown) or SHA hash both make sense. SHA has the advantage of being automatically generated and truly unique per content change, while embedded version requires manual maintenance but is more human-readable.

SHA approach would be:
- Calculate SHA of release notes content during build
- Store that SHA with the bundled file or in a generated file
- Compare against user's last seen SHA

Embedded version approach would be:
- Manually add version/date to markdown file
- Parse that from the content at runtime
- More manual but explicit

Next question should be about when exactly to show the modal - "first request after update" could mean different things.
