## Project Notes

Jesse says the path aliases are wrong. Looking back at the CLAUDE.md instructions:

"Use `~/*` path aliases for internal imports instead of relative paths"
"Example: `import { Agent } from '~/agents/agent'` instead of `import { Agent } from '../../agents/agent.js'`"
"The `~` prefix maps to the `src/` directory via TypeScript path mapping"

But the reviewer is saying to use `~` everywhere, including in packages/web. However, looking at the vite.config.ts:

```
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '~': resolve(__dirname, '../core/src'),
    '@': resolve(__dirname, '.'),
  },
},
```

So:
- `~` maps to `../core/src` (the core package)
- `@` maps to `.` (the web package root)

The reviewer is wrong! For the web package, we should use `@` for internal web imports and `~` for core package imports. The reviewer doesn't understand the monorepo structure.

So the current imports are correct:
- `@/components/...` for web components
- `@/lib/...` for web lib
- `@/types/...` for web types
- `~/agents/...` for core package imports
