## Project Notes

Jesse is seeing a flash of the release notes modal on every reload. This suggests that the modal is initially showing and then hiding quickly. Possible causes:

1. The user settings are loading asynchronously, so initially there's no lastSeenReleaseNotesHash
2. The hook thinks there are new release notes until settings load
3. The modal shows by default and then gets hidden when settings load
4. There's a race condition between the release notes check and settings loading

The ReleaseNotesProvider loads settings asynchronously, and useReleaseNotes runs its effect when settings change. Initially settings might be null/undefined, causing shouldShow to be true, then when settings load it becomes false.

Need to fix the loading state and prevent showing the modal until we know for sure whether to show it.
