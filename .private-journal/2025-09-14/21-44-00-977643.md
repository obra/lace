## Project Notes

Jesse chose option A - show on first page load. This is the most straightforward approach:

- Check on app initialization/first page load
- Compare SHA of current release notes against user's last seen SHA
- Show modal if different
- Update user settings with new SHA after shown

Technical considerations:
- Need to calculate SHA at build time and make it available at runtime
- Could store in a generated file or embed in the bundle
- User settings already has infrastructure for arbitrary data
- Modal system already exists
- Need markdown rendering in modal

Key implementation pieces:
1. Build-time SHA calculation
2. Runtime SHA access
3. User settings integration
4. Modal trigger logic
5. Markdown rendering component

I think I have enough information to start describing the design. Should move to design description phase.
