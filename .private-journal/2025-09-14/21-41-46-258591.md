## Project Notes

Jesse chose option B - SHA hash approach. This is very clean and automated:

- Calculate SHA of release notes content during build
- Any content change automatically triggers new version
- No manual version management needed
- Fits with their preference for automated solutions

Now I need to figure out:
1. When exactly to show the modal ("first request after update")
2. Where to store the calculated SHA for runtime access
3. How to structure the user settings tracking

The "first request after update" is ambiguous - could mean:
- First page load after app update
- First navigation to any route after update  
- First time opening the web UI after update
- Something else

Need to clarify this timing.
