## Project Notes

Jesse updated the RELEASE_NOTES.md file and ran a build, but the system is still showing "no release notes". This suggests the build process isn't finding or processing the RELEASE_NOTES.md file correctly.

Possible issues:
1. The build script might not be running or finding the file
2. The path resolution in the script might be wrong
3. The generated metadata file might not be in the right place
4. The service might not be finding the generated file

Need to debug:
1. Check if the prebuild script actually runs
2. Check if the generated file exists and has the right content
3. Check the path resolution in the generation script
4. Check if the service is looking in the right place
