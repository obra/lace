## Project Notes

Jesse is asking about manualShowModal. Looking at the code, manualShowModal is triggered by the showReleaseNotes function from the context. This would be used when:

1. User clicks the Release Notes tab in settings - they want to manually view the release notes
2. Any UI element that wants to show release notes on demand
3. Help/about sections that might want to show release notes

But looking at the current implementation, I think there might be a better approach. The settings page already shows the release notes content directly in the ReleaseNotesPanel component, so the manual modal might be redundant.

The modal was designed for the "first load after update" use case. For manual viewing, the settings page approach is probably better - just show the content directly in the page rather than a modal.

I should clarify this with Jesse - the manualShowModal might not be needed if the settings page shows the content directly.
