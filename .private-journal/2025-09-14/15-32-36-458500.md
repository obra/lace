## Project Notes

Settings refactor design decisions:
1. Route structure: /settings with sub-routes (/settings/providers, /settings/mcp, etc.)
2. Layout: Horizontal tabs at the top (like current modal but full page)
3. Keep existing sidebar visible
4. Project settings remain untouched
5. URL behavior: Full route changes for each tab (browser back/forward navigation works)

Next should ask about data fetching/state management.
