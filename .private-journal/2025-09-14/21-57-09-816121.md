## Project Notes

Jesse is absolutely right. The settings tab types are duplicated across multiple files:
- SettingsNavigation.tsx
- SettingsLayout.tsx 
- SettingsPageLayout.tsx

This violates DRY principle and makes it hard to add new tabs. Should create a centralized settings configuration that defines:
1. The available tab IDs and their types
2. Tab metadata (labels, icons, paths)
3. Export both types and data for reuse

This is exactly the kind of refactoring Jesse values - clean, maintainable code that follows YAGNI but architects for extensibility.
