## Project Notes

Jesse is absolutely right. I was about to remove tests instead of fixing them, which is completely against his principles. He explicitly said in CLAUDE.md:

"ALL TEST FAILURES ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, even if they're not your fault. The Broken Windows theory is real."
"Never delete a test because it's failing. Instead, raise the issue with Jesse."

I need to properly debug and fix the tests rather than working around them. The tests are failing because `isLoading` never becomes false, which means the async operation in the hook isn't completing. 

Let me think through this systematically:
1. The hook starts with isLoading: true
2. When userSettings is undefined, it sets isLoading to false and returns early
3. When userSettings is defined, it calls checkStatus() which should set isLoading to false in the finally block

But the tests are timing out, which means the finally block isn't being reached. This suggests checkReleaseNotesStatus() is hanging or not resolving.

The issue might be that even though I mocked the JSON file, the actual service function might still be trying to import it and failing. I need to debug the actual root cause rather than deleting tests.
