## Project Notes

Settings refactor complete design finalized:
1. Route structure: /settings with sub-routes (/settings/providers, /settings/mcp, /settings/ui, /settings/user)
2. Layout: Horizontal tabs at the top (like current modal but full page)
3. Keep existing sidebar visible
4. Project settings remain untouched
5. URL behavior: Full route changes for each tab (browser back/forward navigation works)
6. Data loading: Keep current approach with existing providers/hooks
7. Navigation: Both Close/Done button AND sidebar navigation to exit settings

Time to write up the full design specification.
