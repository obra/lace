## Project Notes

Jesse wants to add a release notes system to Lace's web UI. Key requirements:
1. Show release notes as a modal
2. Only show once per update (if notes are newer than last seen version)
3. Track last seen version in user-settings.ts
4. Release notes are rendered markdown

Need to understand the current project structure, especially:
- How the web UI is organized
- Current user settings structure
- Where release notes would live
- How versioning works in the project
- Modal system already in place

This fits the pattern of "show once" notifications that many apps use. Need to think about:
- Where release notes markdown files live
- How versioning is determined
- When to check/show the modal
- How to mark as seen

Going to explore the codebase first to understand current architecture.
