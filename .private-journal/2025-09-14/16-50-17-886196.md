## Project Notes

Provider settings persistence issue:
- The JSON file IS being updated correctly (backend works)
- The UI doesn't reflect the saved changes
- This suggests the component isn't loading the saved modelConfig from the instance data
- Need to check: 1) How instances are fetched, 2) If modelConfig is included in the response, 3) How the component receives and uses it
