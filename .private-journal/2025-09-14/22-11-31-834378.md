## Project Notes

Jesse is saying that the release notes page at /settings/release-notes isn't showing the release notes. Even though we generated the metadata correctly, the service might still not be loading it properly in the browser.

Possible issues:
1. The service might not be finding the generated file at runtime
2. The require() call might not work in the browser environment
3. The build process might not be including the generated file
4. There might be a path resolution issue in the browser

The service uses require() to load the JSON file, but that might not work in the browser. We might need to use an import or a different approach for the web environment.
