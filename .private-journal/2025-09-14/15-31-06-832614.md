## Project Notes

Settings refactor design decisions so far:
1. Route structure: /settings with sub-routes (/settings/providers, /settings/mcp, etc.)
2. Layout: Horizontal tabs at the top (like current modal but full page)
3. Keep existing sidebar visible
4. Project settings remain untouched

Next should ask about URL behavior and navigation.
