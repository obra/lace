## Project Notes

Jesse wants to refactor settings from modal-based to full-page implementation:
- Current: SettingsContainer opens a Modal with tabs (Providers, MCP Servers, UI, User)
- Target: Dedicated /settings routes with sub-routes for each tab
- Keep using existing sidebar components
- Project settings are OUT OF SCOPE - don't touch them
- Route structure would be /settings, /settings/providers, /settings/mcp, /settings/ui, /settings/user

Next I should ask about the navigation/layout pattern within the settings pages.
