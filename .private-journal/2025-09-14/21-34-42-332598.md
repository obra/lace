## Project Notes

Jesse chose option A - static markdown file in the repository that gets bundled. This is the simplest approach and fits with their YAGNI philosophy. 

Now I need to think through:
1. Where exactly should the file live?
2. How to determine the "version" of the release notes
3. How to track what version the user has seen
4. When to show the modal (first request after update)
5. How to render markdown in the modal

Key considerations:
- File should be easily accessible during build/bundling
- Version detection - could use file modification time, package.json version, or embedded version in the markdown
- User settings already has infrastructure for tracking arbitrary data
- Modal system is already built
- Need markdown rendering capability

Next question should be about versioning approach.
