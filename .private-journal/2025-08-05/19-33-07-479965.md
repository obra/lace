## Project Notes

Starting systematic audit of test files 101+ for incorrect setup patterns after git rebase:

1. Hybrid setupCoreTest patterns - Import setupCoreTest but don't use it, or use both setupCoreTest and useTempLaceDir/setupTestPersistence
2. Incorrect provider setup - Using setupTestProviderInstances() instead of createTestProviderInstance() 
3. Missing imports - Call functions without importing them
4. Wrong import paths - Import from wrong locations 
5. Inconsistent cleanup patterns - Not following docs/testing.md cleanup order

Need to be thorough and check ALL remaining files beyond the first 100 alphabetically.
