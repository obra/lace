## Project Notes

Fixed the last two core test files with migration issues:

1. src/persistence/database.test.ts - Had incomplete assignment `db = // setupTestPersistence replaced by setupCoreTest` on line 88. Fixed by:
   - Adding setupCoreTest() call at describe level  
   - Completing assignment with `db = getPersistence();`

2. src/tasks/agent-spawning-update.test.ts - Had incomplete assignment `persistence = // setupTestPersistence replaced by setupCoreTest` on line 17. Fixed by:
   - Adding getPersistence import
   - Adding setupCoreTest() call at describe level
   - Completing assignment with `persistence = getPersistence();`
   - Removing manual persistence.close() call since cleanup is automatic

Both files now compile without TypeScript errors and all tests pass (19 tests total). The migration to unified test setup pattern is complete for these files.
