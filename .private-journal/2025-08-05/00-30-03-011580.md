## Project Notes

Successfully fixed all event data structure mismatches in web package test files:

**Files Fixed**:
- lib/task-metadata-realtime-integration.test.ts: Fixed ToolAggregatedEventData structure, added missing 'call' property
- lib/timeline-converter.test.ts: Removed invalid 'createdAt' from AgentInfo, fixed TOOL_CALL data to use {id, name, arguments}
- types/events.test.ts: Already had correct structure

**Key Changes**:
1. ToolCallEventData structure: {toolName, input} â†’ {id, name, arguments}
2. AgentInfo: removed non-existent 'createdAt' property  
3. ToolAggregatedEventData: ensured 'call' property is present
4. Proper event type usage: TOOL_AGGREGATED for ToolAggregatedEventData

**Testing Status**: All 21 tests now pass, no TypeScript compilation errors.

The event system is quite sophisticated with strict type checking that prevents runtime errors.
