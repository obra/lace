## Project Notes

FOUND THE ROOT CAUSE: Unnecessary mock of getEnvVar() in route.integration.test.ts was intercepting ALL environment variable access and only returning hardcoded values for ANTHROPIC_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY, returning empty string for everything else including LACE_DIR.

This broke test isolation completely. The mock is unnecessary since we already have setupTestProviderDefaults() to set env vars properly. Need to remove this mock entirely.
