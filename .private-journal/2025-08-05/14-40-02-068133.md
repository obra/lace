## Project Notes

Core Test Migration Verification - STATUS: COMPLETE ✅

Migration Summary:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Build process working (npm run build succeeds)
- ✅ setupCoreTest pattern consistently applied
- ✅ No remaining persistence-helper references (except .old files)
- ✅ All core component tests passing (threads, agents, tools)

Fixed Issues:
- thread-manager.test.ts was missing the actual setupCoreTest() call
- Pattern is now consistent across all migrated files

Remaining Failing Tests (NOT related to migration):
- Provider instance credential issues (anthropic-default missing credentials)
- Some integration tests failing due to provider setup
- These are environmental/configuration issues, not migration problems

The core test migration objective is fully achieved. The setupCoreTest pattern provides consistent temporary directory management for all core tests that need persistence.
