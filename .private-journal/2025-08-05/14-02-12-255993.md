## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to migrate ~50 test files from old persistence-helper pattern to new core-test-setup pattern. This is a systematic refactoring task where I need to:
1. Find all files importing from persistence-helper
2. Replace with core-test-setup import
3. Replace setup/teardown calls with setupCoreTest()
4. Remove beforeEach/afterEach blocks

This is exactly the kind of systematic refactoring task I'm good at. Need to be careful to preserve other setup logic and only change persistence-related parts.
