## Project Notes

Fixed mock type issues in web package test files:
- /packages/web/app/full-flow.test.ts: Fixed EventStreamManager spy types
- /packages/web/e2e/sse-integration.test.ts: Fixed spy types + added desiredSize to MockController
- /packages/web/components/pages/__tests__/LaceApp-tasks.test.tsx: Fixed fetch mock implementation

All test files now pass TypeScript type checking with "Type Errors  no errors" confirmation.
