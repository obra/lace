## Project Notes

Looking at the current test situation. The race condition analysis document shows exactly what's been happening - we have test isolation problems between persistence-helper.ts (creating its own temp DB files) and temp-lace-dir.ts (setting LACE_DIR environment variables). 

Looking at the specific test file packages/web/app/api/projects/[projectId]/sessions/route.test.ts, I can see it's using the problematic pattern:

```typescript
const _tempDirContext = useTempLaceDir();        // Sets LACE_DIR=/tmp/lace-test-abc123
beforeEach(async () => {
  setupTestPersistence();                        // Creates DB at /tmp/lace-test-456789.db 
  // Provider instances go to ${LACE_DIR}/provider-instances.json but DB is elsewhere
});
```

This is exactly the race condition described in the analysis document. The solution is clear: rebuild persistence-helper.ts on top of temp-lace-dir.ts so both database and provider instances use the same isolated directory.

However, looking at my todo list, I see the user has asked me to continue from where we left off. The last explicit request was about the remaining ~30-40 TypeScript compilation errors in the web package. Let me check the current TypeScript status first.
