## Project Notes

The hash-routing-persistence.e2e.ts is almost fully working:
- 4/5 tests consistently pass
- 1 test fails intermittently with timeout on project-path-input 

Issue seems to be that the second test is sometimes finding an existing project (avoiding modal) but other times needs to create a project. The logic expects to find "E2E Hash Test Project" but might find different projects.

I should either:
1. Use unique project names per test run (like the working tests do)
2. Or make the existing project search more flexible
3. Or use the same createProject utility that's working in other tests

Looking at the working test #1, it uses "E2E Test Project" and test #3 uses "E2E Full Hierarchy Test" - they don't seem to have issues. Test #2 looks for "E2E Hash Test Project" which may not exist.

The real issue might be that the tests are using hardcoded project names instead of using the testEnv.projectName pattern or creating unique names per run.
