## Project Notes

Database isolation problem: setupWebTest() resetPersistence() isn't providing clean database state. Tests are seeing 1000+ projects instead of starting with clean database.

Issue: resetPersistence() only closes connection, doesn't clear existing data in temp database files. Need true per-test database isolation.
