## Project Notes

Task manager tools test issue resolved: The problem was that Session.create() wasn't properly storing the provider instance configuration in a way that TaskManager could access it for agent spawning.

Need to fix the session configuration setup to ensure TaskManager can access providerInstanceId and modelId when spawning agents for tasks.
