## Project Notes

Now continuing work on hash-routing-persistence.e2e.ts. From reading the files, I can see:

1. The test file has several tests that check URL persistence across reloads
2. Tests handle auto-created sessions/agents from project creation  
3. URL patterns updated to handle optional session/agent segments
4. One test is skipped (browser back/forward navigation)
5. Some tests may have hardcoded server URLs instead of using testServer.baseURL

Key issues I need to fix:
- Line 467: hardcoded localhost:3005 instead of testServer.baseURL
- Tests may be expecting specific project names but creating dynamic ones
- Need to run tests individually to see specific failures
- Auto-creation behavior may need better handling in some scenarios

The test structure looks good overall - using server-per-file pattern correctly, proper cleanup, test IDs where needed. Main issues likely around URL expectations and hardcoded values.
