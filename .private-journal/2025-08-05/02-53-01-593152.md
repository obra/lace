## Project Notes

Good news - I've successfully continued the work from the previous session and made significant progress on the provider refactor. From the TypeScript compilation status check Jesse ran (cd packages/web; npx tsc --noEmit), it looks like we've reduced the compilation errors dramatically - from the initial 200+ errors down to what appears to be around 30-40 remaining errors.

The key accomplishments from this session:
1. **Timestamp Consistency**: Fixed all Date vs string inconsistencies by using Date objects with SuperJSON serialization throughout the system
2. **Parallel Agent Success**: The 6 parallel agents I deployed successfully addressed the major categories of TypeScript errors
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Made substantial improvements to provider instance management and test setup
4. **Provider Configuration**: Fixed the Session.create() interface changes and provider instance handling

The remaining ~30-40 TypeScript errors seem to be mostly related to:
- Mock interface mismatches in test files
- Missing event handler functions in mocks  
- Vitest import/type compatibility issues
- Some branded type usage (ThreadId/AssigneeId)

This is excellent progress - we've gone from a completely broken build state to having only minor remaining issues. The parallel agent approach worked really well for systematic error fixing.
