## Project Notes

Current status of task-spawning branch:
- packages/core/src/threads/types.ts is already modified (M flag in git status)
- packages/core/src/tasks/task-assignment-message.test.ts exists (untracked)
- docs/plans/2025-09-20/model-invocation.md exists (untracked)

The plan seems ready to implement. I notice the test file task-assignment-message.test.ts already exists which might be related to this work. Should check what's already been done before starting.
