## Project Notes

Jesse is showing me the current UI and it's too busy/cluttered. The feedback is:

1. Remove "Model Management" labels - they're redundant
2. Put checkboxes and dropdowns on same line as search - more compact
3. Remove provider badges from instances (the "anthropic", "openai" badges)
4. Remove 'configured' badges 
5. Move sync button and delete buttons to the instance edit pane

This is good feedback - the UI is indeed quite busy. The goal is to clean it up and make it more streamlined. The model management should feel integrated, not like a separate section.
