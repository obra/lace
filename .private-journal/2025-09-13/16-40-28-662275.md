## Project Notes

Analyzing the CodeRabbit review:

**Should we hire this reviewer?**
YES - They're very thorough and caught real issues:
- Spotted the zero-cost filter schema bug (positive() vs nonnegative())
- Found the JSON save deadlock potential 
- Identified capability filtering logic issues
- Caught missing supported_parameters preservation
- Good attention to TypeScript safety and repo conventions

**Issues to fix (high priority):**
1. Zero-cost filter schema bug - prevents "Free only" from working
2. JSON save deadlock potential - could hang saves
3. supported_parameters not preserved - breaks server-side filtering
4. Capability filtering wrong logic - uses supports_attachments for "tools"
5. Remove unused variables/dead code

**Issues to skip:**
- Anything about .private-journal (they're wrong - it's Jesse's private notes)
- Most test mock typing issues (lower priority)
- HTML mockup security issues (dev-only files)
- Documentation hardcoded counts (minor)

**Their analysis quality:**
- Very systematic and thorough
- Good understanding of TypeScript best practices
- Caught subtle bugs that could cause real issues
- Code quality focus aligns with project standards

This reviewer is excellent and would be a good hire.
