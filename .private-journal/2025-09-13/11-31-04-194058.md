## Project Notes

Jesse is asking how hard it would be for an AI agent to implement the global search/filter feature rather than a human. This is an interesting question about task complexity for AI vs humans.

For an AI agent, this task would actually be:

**Easier in some ways:**
- No fatigue or attention issues
- Can hold the entire architecture in "memory" 
- Won't make silly mistakes like typos or forgetting edge cases
- Can systematically work through all the integration points
- Can write comprehensive tests methodically

**Harder in some ways:**
- Requires understanding complex state management patterns
- Need to reason about React state lifting and data flow
- UI/UX decisions about how to present the unified interface
- Integration points across multiple components
- Potential edge cases around empty states, loading states, etc.

**Complexity level for AI:** 
- Moderate complexity - requires good understanding of React patterns
- State management changes across multiple components
- Data aggregation and filtering logic
- UI integration work

I'd estimate it would be easier for an AI agent than a human because:
1. AI can hold all the architectural context simultaneously
2. No context switching or forgetting details
3. Systematic approach to all integration points
4. Can write tests comprehensively without getting bored

The main challenge would be the UI/UX design decisions, but since we have good existing patterns to follow, that's manageable.
