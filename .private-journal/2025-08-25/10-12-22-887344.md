## Project Notes

Lace currently uses Next.js 15.4.6 with a custom server setup (server-custom.ts) that wraps Next.js standalone mode. The architecture shows they have:

- ~50+ API endpoints in app/api/
- React components with TypeScript throughout
- DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS styling
- Custom routing structure for projects/sessions/agents
- Sentry integration
- Complex build setup for standalone mode
- Turbopack disabled due to WASM issues

Current pain points from the codebase analysis:
- Complex webpack/turbopack configuration in next.config.ts
- Extensive standalone build configuration (lines 96-318 in server-custom.ts)
- WASM module incompatibility with Turbopack mentioned in docs
- Build process complexity for single-file executable bundling with Bun

The codebase structure suggests they're already fighting against Next.js conventions - they have a custom server wrapper, complex standalone build setup, and are essentially using Next.js as just a bundler + API route handler rather than leveraging its full-stack capabilities.

Migration considerations:
- Need to preserve all existing API routes structure
- React components should be portable
- DaisyUI/Tailwind setup must be maintained
- TypeScript configuration is already well-established
- Sentry integration needs to be preserved
