## Project Notes

Reviewed Task 4 completion for SessionFileTree component. Key findings:

IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY:
- Both files exist and follow all requirements
- Clean TypeScript with no `any` types
- Proper ABOUTME headers
- Uses existing patterns from codebase
- API integration matches expected patterns
- Tests are comprehensive and pass

ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT:
- Follows atomic design principles from play page
- Uses existing FontAwesome icons correctly
- Proper import patterns (~ aliases, no extensions)
- Integrates with session-scoped API endpoints
- Matches existing UI component patterns

TESTING:
- 8 tests covering all core functionality
- Tests real behavior, not mocks (follows core rule)
- Covers loading, file selection, directory expansion, search, errors
- Uses proper TypeScript typing throughout
- All tests pass successfully

DEVIATIONS FROM PLAN:
- Component structure matches plan exactly
- No significant deviations found
- Implementation is actually cleaner than plan template

READY FOR INTEGRATION:
- Component API matches what FileBrowserSection expects
- Proper exports for consumption
- Error handling and loading states work correctly
- Search functionality implemented properly
