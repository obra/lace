## Project Notes

Code review improvements completed for thread compaction system:

âœ… COMPLETED FIXES:
- Error handling: Wrap strategy.compact() with try-catch and fallback
- Performance: Cache provider strategies to avoid repeated creation
- Type safety: Use proper EventType instead of 'as any' 
- Resource management: Clear strategy cache on close()
- Robustness: Protection against division by zero

SPECIFIC CHANGES:
- src/threads/thread-manager.ts: Added provider strategy cache with _getProviderStrategy() helper
- src/threads/compaction/summarize-strategy.ts: Fixed compression ratio calculation 
- src/threads/compaction/__tests__/summarize-strategy.test.ts: Fixed type imports

The PR now has production-ready error handling and performance optimizations while maintaining the clean architecture from the simplification refactor.

REMAINING ITEMS:
- Make hardcoded values configurable (low priority)
- Documentation improvements (JSDoc comments)
- Additional structured logging

The thread compaction feature is now robust and ready for production use.
