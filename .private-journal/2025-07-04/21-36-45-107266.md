## Project Notes

The tool renderer refactoring is essentially complete. All 7 tool renderers have been migrated to direct composition with TimelineEntry, context architecture is implemented for all timeline items, and all existing tests have been updated to work with the new context-based approach. The test files I just examined show good coverage of the new TimelineEntry integration.

The final optional task would be to add specific tests for TimelineItemContext provider/hook behavior, but the core architectural work is done.
