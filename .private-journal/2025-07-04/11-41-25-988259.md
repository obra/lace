## Project Notes

Thread shadowing simplification refactor completed for Lace:

COMPLETED WORK:
- ✅ Implemented provider-aware token counting in SummarizeStrategy
- ✅ Created simplified createCompactedVersion() method using composition 
- ✅ Updated Agent compaction integration (15 lines → 4 lines)
- ✅ Simplified getCanonicalId() to 3-line lookup
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with legacy method forwards
- ✅ Updated all terminology from "shadow thread" to "compacted thread"
- ✅ All 283 tests passing

KEY FILES MODIFIED:
- src/threads/thread-manager.ts: Added createCompactedVersion(), simplified getCanonicalId()
- src/agents/agent.ts: Simplified compaction integration, updated comments
- src/threads/compaction/summarize-strategy.ts: Added provider-aware token counting
- src/threads/persistence.ts: Updated comments to use "compacted thread"
- All test files: Updated descriptions and variable names

ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT:
The key insight was recognizing that "shadow threads ARE threads" - no special handling needed. Just use composition of existing operations rather than complex transaction-based shadow creation.

The simplified approach:
1. Get compacted events from strategy
2. Create new thread (existing method)
3. Add events to new thread (existing method)  
4. Update version mapping
5. Switch to new thread (existing method)

Much cleaner than the previous approach!
