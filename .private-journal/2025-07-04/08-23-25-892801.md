## Project Notes

Implementing component-based tool renderer architecture:

Key design decisions:
1. Keep backward compatibility - existing TimelineEntry component stays
2. Start with shared infrastructure before migrating individual renderers
3. Use TypeScript discriminated unions for tool-specific data
4. Make hooks composable so complex tools like delegate can build on basics

Implementation order:
1. Create base hooks (useToolData, useToolState)
2. Create ToolDisplay component with customizable sections
3. Migrate simplest renderer first (FileListToolRenderer) as proof of concept
4. Then migrate others incrementally
5. Handle DelegateToolRenderer last as it's most complex

Things to watch out for:
- Don't break existing functionality
- Match existing visual output exactly
- Preserve all keyboard shortcuts and focus behavior
- Keep performance characteristics (memoization where needed)
