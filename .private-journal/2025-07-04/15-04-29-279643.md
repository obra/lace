## Project Notes

Retry Implementation Strategy for Lace:

1. **Where to Add Retry Logic**:
   - Option A: In each provider's implementation (lots of duplication)
   - Option B: In base provider as a wrapper (DRY, but needs careful design)
   - Option C: As a separate retry utility that wraps provider calls
   - Recommendation: Option C - keep retry logic separate and composable

2. **Configuration Approach**:
   - Add retry settings to ProviderConfig interface
   - Default settings in base provider
   - Environment variable overrides (LACE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS, etc.)
   - Per-provider customization possible

3. **Error Classification**:
   - Network errors (ECONNREFUSED, ETIMEDOUT, etc.) - retry
   - Rate limits (429) - retry with backoff
   - Server errors (500-503) - retry
   - Client errors (400, 401, 403, 404) - don't retry
   - Streaming errors - special handling needed

4. **Streaming Challenges**:
   - Can't simply retry mid-stream
   - Need to restart entire streaming request
   - Must clean up event listeners properly
   - Token events already emitted can't be "taken back"

5. **AbortSignal Handling**:
   - Must check signal.aborted before each retry
   - Clean up properly on abort
   - Don't retry aborted requests
