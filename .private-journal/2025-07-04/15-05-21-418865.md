## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to investigate error types and retry capabilities in the Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs. This is likely for implementing retry logic with exponential backoff in the Lace codebase. I should look for:
1. Error class hierarchies
2. Built-in retry mechanisms
3. Configuration options for retries
4. Which errors are retryable vs permanent
5. Any existing exponential backoff implementations
