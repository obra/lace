## Project Notes

**Lace-Ink CLI Parity Analysis Session**

Just completed comprehensive analysis of what CLI improvements need to be implemented in the Ink UI to achieve parity with the enhanced console interface.

**Key Findings:**

## Current Old CLI System (src/interface/console.js):

- **Activity Logging Integration**: Full ActivityLogger with SQLite database for forensic audit trails
- **Web Companion Integration**: WebServer with extensive API endpoints for real-time activity streaming
- **Command Registry**: 15+ commands with parameterized support (/auto-approve, /deny, etc.)
- **Advanced Tool Approval**: TypeScript-based ApprovalEngine with risk assessment
- **File/Command Completion**: History tracking, file path completion, command completion
- **Session Management**: Persistent history, session IDs, abort handling
- **Status/Monitoring**: Context usage display, model pricing info, token tracking
- **Memory Management**: Agent handoff, conversation history access
- **Interrupt Handling**: Ctrl+C abort, streaming cancellation

## Current Ink UI System (src/ui/):

- **Basic Chat Interface**: Message display, streaming support, basic commands
- **Limited Commands**: Only 8 commands vs 15+ in CLI
- **Tool Approval Modal**: Working but not integrated with full approval engine
- **Completion System**: File completion only, no command completion integration
- **No Activity Logging**: Missing forensic audit trail completely
- **No Web Integration**: No WebServer or companion UI support
- **Basic Status**: No context usage, pricing, or detailed agent status
- **Limited Memory**: No conversation history access or agent handoff

## Missing Critical Systems:

1. ActivityLogger integration for forensic trails
2. WebServer integration for companion UI
3. Full command registry parity
4. Advanced tool approval engine
5. Session persistence and history
6. Agent status and monitoring
7. Context usage and pricing display
8. Memory/handoff management
9. Complete abort/interrupt handling

This represents about 70% missing functionality that needs to be ported to achieve CLI parity.
