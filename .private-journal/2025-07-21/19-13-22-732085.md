## Project Notes

Analyzed web package test files in Lace project. Found mix of unit tests with heavy mocking and some e2e tests that use real services. Key findings:

HIGH-VALUE MOCKS TO CONVERT TO E2E:
1. TaskAPIClient in useTaskManager.test.tsx - Currently mocked but API client behavior is critical for UI
2. SSE/EventSource mocks across tests - Real-time communication is central to app functionality  
3. fetch mocks in client tests - Should use real HTTP calls to catch integration issues
4. Tool execution mocks - Many tests mock the core tool functionality rather than testing end-to-end

PATTERN: Tests labeled as "integration" or "e2e" still use significant mocking, especially of external dependencies like SSE, approval manager, and API clients. This reduces the value of integration testing.

GOOD E2E EXAMPLES:
- full-flow.test.ts mostly uses real services (though still mocks SSE and approval manager)
- api-endpoints.test.ts uses real API routes with minimal mocking
- tool-approval-flow.test.ts uses real file system operations

MAIN BENEFIT: Converting client-side API mocks to e2e would catch API contract mismatches, SSE connection issues, and real-time sync problems that are currently hidden by mocks.
