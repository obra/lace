## Project Notes

Good idea from Jesse! Instead of duplicating the model dropdown logic everywhere, I should create a reusable component. This will make the code more maintainable and ensure consistent behavior across all model dropdowns.

I should create a `ModelDropdown` component that takes:
- providers array
- selectedProvider 
- selectedModel
- onChange callback
- className (optional)
- label (optional)

This will handle all the logic of finding the right provider, getting its models, showing fallback messages, etc.
