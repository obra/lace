## Project Notes

I've been continuing from a previous conversation where we were implementing API integration for a Lace web app. I've completed the agent update API, session configuration loading, and project configuration loading. Now I need to finish the project creation modal that was in progress.

Looking at the API routes I've read:
- /app/api/projects/route.ts - handles GET all projects and POST new project
- /app/api/projects/[projectId]/configuration/route.ts - handles GET/PUT for project configuration
- /app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.ts - handles GET/PATCH/DELETE for individual projects

The project creation modal needs to POST to /api/projects with:
- name (required)
- description (optional) 
- workingDirectory (required)
- configuration (optional object)

I should check the current state of the ProjectSelectorPanel.tsx to see what compilation issues exist and complete the implementation.
