## Project Notes

Jesse is absolutely right. I was adding fallback logic (`model.id || model.name`) when I should just fix the type mismatch properly. The API is clearly returning `id` and `displayName` for models, and `name`, `displayName`, `configured` for providers. I should update the frontend types to match the API exactly instead of adding confusing fallback logic.

Looking at the API response:
- Providers have: `name`, `displayName`, `configured` (not `type`, `name`, `available`)
- Models have: `id`, `displayName` (not `name`, `displayName`)

I need to:
1. Update the TypeScript interfaces to match the API
2. Update all the UI code to use the correct field names
3. Remove the fallback || logic I just added
