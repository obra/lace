## Project Notes

The user confirmed that the session edit provider dropdown now works (so my fix for the provider filtering was successful), but the model dropdown still doesn't work. This suggests that the models array is empty or not being populated correctly.

Looking at the code, the models come from:
```typescript
const editSessionAvailableModels = useMemo(() => {
  const provider = providers.find(p => p.type === editSessionConfig.provider);
  return provider?.models || [];
}, [providers, editSessionConfig.provider]);
```

So the issue could be:
1. The provider doesn't have models
2. The provider.models array is empty
3. There's a mismatch in provider types
4. The editSessionConfig.provider value doesn't match any provider.type

I need to check how the models are being used in the session edit modal dropdown.
