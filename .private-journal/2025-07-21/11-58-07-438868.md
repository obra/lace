## Project Notes

Working on Phase 2 Task 2.2 of the test remediation plan. I've already:
1. Completed comprehensive mock inventory in docs/mock-inventory.md  
2. Started documenting essential mocks with explanatory comments
3. Added comments to src/providers/anthropic-provider.test.ts

Next I need to continue adding explanatory comments to other essential mocks from the inventory:
- Other provider tests (OpenAI, LMStudio, Ollama)
- Configuration mocks (env-loader, lace-dir) 
- System operation mocks (child_process)
- Logger mocks

The pattern is to add comments explaining WHY external dependencies need mocking while business logic should use real implementations.
