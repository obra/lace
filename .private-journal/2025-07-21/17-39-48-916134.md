## Project Notes

Fixed CLI args tests by applying the established pattern from commands.test.ts:

- Transformed 12 different mock interaction patterns to behavior-focused testing
- Created CLITestCapture helper class to centralize CLI behavior capture
- All 30 tests now pass and test actual CLI behavior instead of mock interactions
- Tests are now more maintainable and focused on user-visible outcomes

The key insight was that CLI argument parsing is about validating input and producing output/errors - testing the actual error messages and exit behavior is much more valuable than testing that specific console methods were called.
