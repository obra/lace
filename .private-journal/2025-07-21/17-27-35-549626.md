## Project Notes

The user is reporting several UI issues with the session management:
1. Provider and model dropdowns are empty in session config
2. Session display shows no agents 
3. There's no agent edit UI

This suggests the session configuration isn't properly loading provider/model data, and the agent management UI might not be implemented or connected properly. I need to investigate the SessionConfigPanel and see how it's getting provider data, and check if the agent editing functionality is missing.

Looking at the previous conversation summary, it seems like I implemented API integration but might have missed some of the UI connections or data flow issues.
