## Project Notes

The sidebar is still vanishing! This is frustrating. Let me think through what could be happening:

1. The debug info shows "Sidebar: VISIBLE" so the React state is correct
2. We fixed the flex layout issue by using conditional rendering with `{showDesktopSidebar && ...}`
3. We added proper flex classes `flex-shrink-0`
4. But the sidebar still disappears

Wait, I think I might know what's happening. When we moved to conditional rendering with `{showDesktopSidebar && (...)}`, we're only rendering the sidebar when the state is true. But if there's a race condition or re-render that temporarily sets showDesktopSidebar to false (even briefly), the entire sidebar DOM element would disappear and reappear.

The original code had the Sidebar component manage its own visibility with the `isOpen` prop, using `hidden lg:flex` classes. Maybe we should go back to that approach but fix the layout issue differently.

Let me revert to the Sidebar component handling its own visibility and fix the flex layout issue in a different way.
