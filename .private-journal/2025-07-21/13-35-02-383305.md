## Project Notes

Looking at the LaceApp.tsx file, I can see the debug info is still there on lines 488-491:

```typescript
{/* Debug info */}
<div className="fixed top-0 left-0 bg-red-500 text-white p-2 z-50 text-xs">
  Sidebar: {showDesktopSidebar ? 'VISIBLE' : 'HIDDEN'}
</div>
```

The user reported "after i pick an agent, sidebar goes away" which means the `showDesktopSidebar` state is changing unexpectedly when an agent is selected. Looking at the agent selection handler on line 325-328:

```typescript
const handleAgentSelect = (agentThreadId: string) => {
  setSelectedAgent(agentThreadId as ThreadId);
  setEvents([]);
};
```

This doesn't directly modify `showDesktopSidebar`, so the issue must be elsewhere. Let me trace through what happens during agent selection:

1. User clicks on an agent in the sidebar
2. `handleAgentSelect` is called, setting `selectedAgent` 
3. This triggers the useEffect on line 150 that sets up SSE connection
4. The useEffect clears events and loads conversation history

I need to check if there's something in the layout or CSS that's causing the sidebar to disappear. The sidebar wrapper on line 487 just has `className="h-full"` so it's letting the Sidebar component control its own visibility with the `hidden lg:flex` classes.

The issue might be that something is changing the `showDesktopSidebar` state during agent selection. Let me look more carefully at the effects and handlers to see if there's an unexpected state change.
