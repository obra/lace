## Project Notes

Current state: All major UI work is complete. The comprehensive project, session, and agent editing modals are implemented with full configuration options. The main tasks remaining are:

1. API integrations - connecting existing modals to load/save real data
2. Project creation modal - can reuse existing edit modal structure 
3. Tests - need comprehensive test suite

The codebase now has a solid foundation with DaisyUI design system, consistent patterns, and proper TypeScript typing. The event-driven architecture remains intact while the UI has been modernized.

Key files modified:
- LaceApp.tsx - main app with providers integration
- ProjectSelectorPanel.tsx - comprehensive project management
- SessionConfigPanel.tsx - comprehensive session/agent management

All follow established patterns for state management, form handling, and modal interactions.
