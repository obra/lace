## Project Notes

Interesting! The logs show that `showDesktopSidebar` stays `true` throughout the agent selection process, and the `handleAgentSelect` function completes successfully. But Jesse reports that the sidebar shows for *some* sessions but not others.

This suggests the issue isn't with the React state or the handleAgentSelect function itself, but might be related to:

1. **Session-specific data**: Different sessions might have different data structures that cause rendering issues
2. **Agent data**: Some sessions might have malformed agent data that breaks the sidebar rendering
3. **Async loading**: The sidebar might disappear during loading states for some sessions
4. **CSS/layout conflicts**: Certain combinations of selected session/agent might trigger different CSS states

The fact that it's session-specific makes me think it's likely related to the data being loaded or the rendering logic in the SidebarSection components when they receive different types of session/agent data.

I should check:
- Are there differences in the session data structure between working and non-working sessions?
- Is there an error being thrown during rendering that's causing a component to fail?
- Are there any conditional renders in the sidebar that depend on session/agent data?

The MobileSidebar import error for `faXmark` is also worth fixing, but probably not related to this desktop sidebar issue.
