## Project Notes

Successfully applied the established testing pattern from commands.test.ts to executor.test.ts:

Key Pattern Transformations Made:
1. Created test helpers that capture actual behavior:
   - `TestCommand` class that tracks actual execution calls instead of using mocks
   - `TestUI` class that captures displayed messages and UI interactions
   
2. Replaced mock interaction tests with outcome verification:
   - OLD: `expect(mockExecute).toHaveBeenCalledWith('args', mockUI)`
   - NEW: `expect(testCommand.wasExecuted()).toBe(true)` + detailed execution verification
   
3. Focus on "what happened" rather than "what was called":
   - Test actual command execution results
   - Verify error messages were displayed correctly
   - Check argument parsing and forwarding behavior
   - Test command registry integration properly
   
4. Added comprehensive edge case and integration tests:
   - Multiple command execution independence
   - Registry lookup behavior 
   - Error handling for different error types
   - Context passing verification
   - Complex argument parsing validation

The pattern is much more robust because:
- Tests verify actual behavior rather than implementation details
- Breaking changes to internal APIs don't break tests unnecessarily
- Tests serve as better documentation of expected behavior
- More resistant to refactoring while still catching real bugs

Total transformation: 11 old mock-based tests â†’ 25 comprehensive behavior-based tests
All tests pass, demonstrating the approach works well for command execution testing.
