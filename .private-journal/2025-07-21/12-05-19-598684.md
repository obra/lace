## Project Notes

Jesse stopped me from hacking and made me read the actual architecture docs. Key learnings:

**Architecture Reality:**
1. **Sessions contain agents** - A session is a parent thread with child threads (agents)
2. **Thread hierarchy**: `session.1`, `session.2` for agents within session 
3. **Agent-focused UI**: Timeline view should focus on agents, not sessions
4. **Hierarchical sidebar**: Project → Sessions → Agents

**ThreadId typing**: Jesse mentioned ThreadId needs proper typing - it's not just a string

**Mocking strategy**: Mock as little as possible, only network dependencies

**Integration philosophy**: We're integrating design system INTO the app, not adapting infrastructure TO design system

**Missing pieces I need to understand:**
- How agent spawning works within sessions
- How the sidebar should show the Project → Session → Agent hierarchy  
- How Timeline view should receive agent data, not session data
- How agent selection should work vs session selection
