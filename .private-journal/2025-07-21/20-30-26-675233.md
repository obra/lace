## Project Notes

Jesse's project has sophisticated testing infrastructure with established patterns:
- Real API route testing via mock fetch routing (not HTTP server)
- Temporary directory helpers for isolated test environments  
- Playwright E2E tests with proper setup/teardown
- Mix of unit, integration, and e2e test levels

The model display bug was subtle but critical - API route was using hardcoded fallbacks instead of actual agent properties. Fixed by using `agent.model` directly.

The hash routing system now provides complete URL-based state persistence that survives page reloads and supports deep linking. All tests passing and system working correctly as validated through both manual and automated testing.
