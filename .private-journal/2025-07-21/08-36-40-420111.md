## Project Notes

User is reporting an issue with the web UI where creating an agent in a session doesn't save the model. They want me to investigate this using Playwright MCP tools. 

This sounds like it could be:
1. A frontend form issue where the model field isn't being captured properly
2. A backend API issue where the model isn't being persisted
3. A validation issue where the model field is being dropped

I should use Playwright to:
1. Navigate to the web UI
2. Create a session 
3. Try to create an agent with a specific model
4. Check if the model is saved properly
5. Inspect the network requests to see if the model is being sent to the backend
6. Check the response to see if it's being returned properly

This will help identify where in the flow the model information is getting lost.
