## Project Notes

Looking at the screenshot, I can see several issues:

1. **Session edit doesn't show up when picking a project** - The user expects to see session management UI immediately when selecting a project, but it only appears when clicking "edit session". This suggests the SessionConfigPanel might not be showing by default.

2. **No models show up even though providers do** - This confirms my ModelDropdown fix didn't completely solve the issue. The providers are loading but models aren't. This could mean:
   - The providers have empty models arrays
   - The ModelDropdown component has a bug
   - The API is returning providers without models

3. **New Session button position** - The user wants the "New Session" button moved down, probably below the sessions list instead of at the top right.

4. **Project edit access** - The user wants to be able to access project edit from the session management screen.

The main issue seems to be that when a project is selected, it's not immediately showing the session configuration panel. Instead, the user has to click on a specific session to get to session management. This suggests the LaceApp isn't properly rendering the SessionConfigPanel by default when a project is selected.

Let me check the LaceApp component to see the conditional rendering logic.
