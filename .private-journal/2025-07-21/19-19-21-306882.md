## Project Notes

The web test suite is in excellent shape after our systematic fixes:
- 44 test files, 372 passing tests, 0 failures
- Fixed all the major issues: React imports, act() warnings, type mismatches, real file operations
- Already has good e2e patterns in api-endpoints.test.ts using real services
- TaskAPIClient mocks are the highest priority for e2e conversion since they test critical UI-to-API integration
- EventSource/SSE mocks are second priority since real-time features are core to the app
- The existing pattern uses real service calls (sessionService.createSession()) rather than complex API route mocking, which is the right approach
