## Project Notes

Reviewed the dev's implementation of the toolbox-style timeline enhancement. The implementation is excellent and closely matches our specification:

**What was implemented:**
- SideMarkerRenderer component with status-based colored side markers
- Character selection: ⊂ for 1 line, ╭/╰ for 2 lines, ╭/│/╰ for 3+ lines  
- Color coding: grey/yellow/green/red with bright variants when selected
- Proper integration with existing CollapsibleBox system
- Status propagation from tool execution results to visual markers
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Key technical solutions:**
- Avoided circular measurement dependency by measuring only content, not markers
- Used setTimeout deferral for proper DOM update timing
- Provided contentHeight override for explicit control
- Extended theme system cleanly with new symbols and colors

**Current state:**
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated in working-with-ink.md with new patterns
- Both ToolExecutionDisplay and GenericToolRenderer updated to pass status
- Theme system extended with toolbox symbols and colors

The implementation looks production-ready and follows all the architectural patterns we specified. No issues found.
