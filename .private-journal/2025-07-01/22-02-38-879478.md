## Project Notes

Key deviations from tool-updates.md plan:
1. Task tool: Kept name as task_add (not tasks_add) and used JSON string format for bulk operations instead of array schema - this was cleaner due to schema constraints
2. Error messages: Implemented structured format without PROBLEM/SOLUTION/CONTEXT labels as user requested
3. Phase 4.2 integration testing hasn't been done yet

The plan's validation checklist shows what we accomplished:
✅ All search tools limit to 50 results by default  
✅ Task tool accepts multiple tasks (via JSON array strings)
✅ Error messages follow consistent format with BaseTool
✅ All tests pass
✅ Build succeeds 
✅ Linting passes
❓ Integration tests pass (not run yet)
❓ Manual CLI testing (not done yet)
