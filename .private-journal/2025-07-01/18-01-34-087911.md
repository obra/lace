## Project Notes

Timeline auto-jump implementation now has cleaner code organization. The `jumpToBottom` helper is used in both the "new content" effect and the "streaming content height" effect, ensuring consistent positioning behavior. All tests still pass and linting is clean. The next optimization opportunities are: 1) consolidating the two positioning effects for better performance, and 2) adding comprehensive test coverage for the auto-jump behavior. This DRY refactor makes the code more maintainable and easier to reason about.
