## Project Notes

The task notification system is actually more complete than the implementer claimed. Looking at the git history and code:

**What's actually implemented:**
1. ✅ Phase 1: Core infrastructure with types and interfaces
2. ✅ Phase 2: Session integration 
3. ✅ Phase 3: Comprehensive notification logic INCLUDING note notifications
4. ✅ Phase 4: Integration testing with comprehensive real-world scenarios
5. ❌ Phase 5: Was ALREADY DONE in Phase 3 - note notifications fully implemented

**The confusion:**
The implementer added `task-assignment-message.test.ts` which tests:
- Whether agents receive initial task assignment messages when spawned
- Validation of task creation parameters
- Edge cases around task assignment

This is useful testing but it's not "Phase 5: Note Notifications" from the plan. It's actually validation testing for the task assignment flow.

**Quality assessment of what was actually implemented:**
- The note notification implementation in `task-notifications.ts` is solid
- Includes proper length filtering (>50 chars for significant notes)
- Prevents self-notifications  
- Integration tests comprehensively cover note scenarios
- The "Phase 5" work (task assignment message testing) is also high quality but unrelated to the plan

**Conclusion:** Phase 5 was already complete. The implementer worked on something different while thinking it was Phase 5.
