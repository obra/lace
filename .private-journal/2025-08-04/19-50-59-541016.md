## Project Notes

Looking at the Playwright E2E test file, I can see it's already using a shared test utilities approach but still relies on a global server setup that we've removed from the Playwright config. The test server utility I created is complete but not yet integrated.

The test file currently uses helpers from `./helpers/test-utils` but doesn't start its own server. I need to update the Playwright test to use the new `startTestServer()` utility I created.

Key insight: The test currently expects to navigate to pages via the page object, but without a global server, it needs to start its own server first and then navigate to that server's baseURL.
