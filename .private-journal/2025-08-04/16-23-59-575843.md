## Project Notes

Current state of provider instance migration:

COMPLETED:
- Session class accepts providerInstanceId/modelId ✓
- Session.spawnAgent uses new config interface ✓  
- All 71+ spawnAgent calls across codebase migrated ✓
- Test utilities for provider instances in place ✓

REMAINING ISSUES (based on failing tests):
- Project class likely still using old provider strings
- Some tests expecting old field names
- Need to verify all components use new interface

The Project class note at line 68-70 in project.ts says "No longer automatically creating a default session since Session.create() now requires provider instances" - this suggests Project was updated but may not be complete.

Strategy: Focus on Project class first since it's likely the source of many test failures.
