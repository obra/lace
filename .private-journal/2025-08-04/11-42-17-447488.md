## Project Notes

I see the current state of the prompt renderers work - all tasks appear complete:

1. MarkdownRenderer has proper security with DOMPurify sanitization for links
2. Performance optimized with memoized truncation in useFoldableContent hook 
3. Folding logic properly extracted to reusable hook with template literal line count display
4. All dependencies added to package.json (react-markdown, remark-gfm, rehype-highlight, dompurify)
5. Components follow existing patterns (UnknownEventEntry has the same 4-line MAX_LINES pattern)

The todo list shows all tasks completed. Looking at the files, everything seems properly implemented:
- useFoldableContent.ts: Clean reusable hook with memoized truncation
- MarkdownRenderer.tsx: Secure, performant markdown rendering with proper folding
- package.json: All required dependencies present
- UnknownEventEntry.tsx: Shows the existing 4-line folding pattern we matched

The work appears complete. The PR was created and should be ready for review. No further action needed unless Jesse has additional requests.
