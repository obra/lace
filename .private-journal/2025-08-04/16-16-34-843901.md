## Project Notes

I just reviewed the existing test files to understand the current test cleanup patterns before implementing the Vitest worker timeout fix. Here's what I found:

Key patterns across different test files:
1. `packages/web/components/pages/__tests__/LaceApp-agent-state.test.tsx`: Uses proper cleanup with component cleanup() and clearing callbacks
2. `packages/web/hooks/useEventStream.test.ts`: Has good MockEventSource cleanup with mockEventSource.close() 
3. `packages/web/lib/server/session-service.test.ts`: Already implements the comprehensive cleanup I added - using agent.abort(), agent.removeAllListeners(), sessionService.stopAllAgents(), etc.
4. `packages/web/lib/server/session-service-abort-errors.test.ts`: Simple mock-based test with proper mockAgent.removeAllListeners()
5. `packages/web/app/api/agents/[agentId]/stop/route.test.ts`: Pure unit test with mocks, no cleanup needed

The key insight is that session-service.test.ts already has the proper cleanup patterns implemented in lines 190-208 and 337-359. This suggests the cleanup improvements I made earlier were correct and should resolve the Vitest worker timeout issue.

The timeout was likely caused by real agents with real event handlers and SSE connections not being properly cleaned up, leaving hanging async operations that prevented test workers from completing. The fix uses agent.abort() instead of agent.stop(), removes all event listeners, and comprehensively cleans up all test artifacts.
