## Project Notes

Work Package 1: Provider Resolution Infrastructure - COMPLETED

Successfully implemented the complete replacement infrastructure as requested:

1. ✅ Provider Resolution Infrastructure (src/sessions/provider-resolution.ts)
   - Completely replaced backward compatibility functions
   - Added findProviderInstanceForType() - resolves provider types to real instance IDs
   - Added validateProviderInstance() - validates instance exists and supports model
   - NO FALLBACKS - throws clear errors when instances don't exist
   - Added normalizeProviderType() for common provider aliases

2. ✅ API Types Update (packages/web/types/api.ts)
   - Updated CreateAgentRequest to REQUIRE providerInstanceId and modelId
   - Removed optional fields - complete replacement approach
   - No legacy fields remaining

3. ✅ Test Provider Instance Factory (src/test-utils/provider-instances.ts)
   - createTestProviderInstance() - creates real provider instances for tests
   - setupTestProviderInstances() - sets up common Anthropic/OpenAI instances
   - createTestLMStudioInstance() / createTestOllamaInstance() - local providers
   - cleanupTestProviderInstances() - proper test cleanup
   - getTestProviderInstances() - debugging helper
   - All functions create REAL provider instances, not mocks

Key observations:
- Build shows many test files still using old 'provider' field - this is expected
- The infrastructure is complete and ready for other work packages to use
- Complete replacement approach working as intended - TypeScript enforcing the new system
- Clear error messages when provider instances aren't configured
- Ready to support migration of test files and calling code

This infrastructure enables other work packages to migrate cleanly from old provider strings to provider instances.
