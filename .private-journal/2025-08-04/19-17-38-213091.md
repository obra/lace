## Project Notes

The user is referencing commit 77588d21a28fd5fe53172849a3d6df99714fd959 that was supposed to move tests to the current branch but didn't complete. They've manually moved the tests. This suggests some git operation didn't complete fully. Need to check current branch state and see what tests were moved and if they need any fixes to work with the current codebase.
