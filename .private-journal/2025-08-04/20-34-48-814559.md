## Project Notes

Jesse wants to fix the modal issue that's causing Playwright E2E test failures. Based on my analysis, the root cause is that the ProjectSelectorPanel has a broken modal structure that combines the backdrop and content container into one element, causing pointer event interception.

The solution is to either:
1. Replace the custom modal with existing Modal components 
2. Fix the structure to separate backdrop from content

I should find the ProjectSelectorPanel component and fix the modal implementation to use the proper pattern that works in other parts of the codebase.
