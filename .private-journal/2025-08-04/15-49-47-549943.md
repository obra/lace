## Project Notes

Based on previous conversation context, Jesse asked me to continue working after completing the comprehensive spawnAgent migration. The remaining work from the plan focuses on:

1. **Provider Discovery API** - `/api/providers` route is "COMPLETELY WRONG" according to the design docs, showing old environment-based providers instead of configured instances
2. **Frontend Integration** - Components like `LaceApp.tsx` and `ProviderDropdown.tsx` need to use provider instances from `/api/provider/instances`
3. **Missing API Endpoints** - Need `GET /api/provider/instances/[instanceId]/models`
4. **Schema Updates** - Session/agent creation schemas need proper provider instance support

The full-flow test I just examined confirms the web API layer migration is working correctly - it's using the new provider instance system throughout. This means the core integration is solid and I should focus on the remaining frontend integration pieces.

Jesse's guidance was clear: "full TDD", "no backward compatibility", "complete replacement", and "focus on core before web APIs". Since core is done, it's time for the web API fixes.
