## Project Notes

Starting Work Package 1: Provider Resolution Infrastructure. Jesse wants complete replacement of old provider strings with provider instances for spawnAgent() calls. Key focus:
- NO backward compatibility - complete replacement only
- Create utilities to convert from old provider strings to actual provider instance IDs
- Helper to find real provider instance IDs for given provider types
- Test utilities that create real provider instances
- API types updated to only support provider instances

This is infrastructure work that enables other work packages to migrate cleanly.
