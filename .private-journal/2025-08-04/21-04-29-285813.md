## Project Notes

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE MISTAKE: I was trying to fix failing tests by adding provider configuration to projects, but that's backwards! 

The architecture is:
- Projects can have default provider configuration (optional)
- Sessions inherit defaults from projects (automatic)
- Only when spawning agents do we need provider instances
- Session.create() should NOT require provider configuration

The error "No provider configuration available - project must specify providerInstanceId and modelId" is coming from Session.create() line 116-118. This suggests the getEffectiveConfiguration() call isn't finding any provider configuration.

But the issue might be:
1. Projects created in tests don't have provider defaults
2. There's no fallback when no provider config is found
3. The session creation is failing too early

Need to look at why getEffectiveConfiguration() isn't finding defaults or providing fallbacks.
