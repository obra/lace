## Project Notes

Looking at the existing web.md docs, I can see they're quite comprehensive but there are some things I learned from working on the timeline renderers that should be documented:

1. Timeline system architecture - how events map to timeline renderers
2. Component architecture patterns (Entry suffix, icon usage, styling conventions)
3. Markdown rendering approach with security and performance considerations
4. Folding/truncation patterns used across components
5. Design system integration with DaisyUI classes
6. Hook patterns for reusable logic

The docs mention "No syntax highlighting" as a limitation but that's now fixed with the MarkdownRenderer. Also should update the UI components section to include timeline components and markdown rendering.

I should also document the discriminated union pattern used for timeline entries and how event type mapping works between backend and frontend.
