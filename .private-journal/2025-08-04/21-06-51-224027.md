## Project Notes

ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT: Default provider configuration should come from user's LaceDir, not be hardcoded.

The flow should be:
1. Session.create() tries to get effective config from project
2. If no provider config found, fall back to system-wide defaults from LaceDir
3. Those defaults should include default provider instances and models

This is much cleaner than hardcoding defaults and aligns with the overall configuration hierarchy:
- User global config (LaceDir) 
- Project config (inherits from global)
- Session config (inherits from project)
- Agent config (inherits from session)

Need to look at how LaceDir configuration works and where default provider instances are stored.
