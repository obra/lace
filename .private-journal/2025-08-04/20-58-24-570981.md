## Project Notes

Continuing project test fixing work in provider-refactor branch. I had successfully cleaned up TypeScript and ESLint issues in the core project and was in the middle of fixing project test expectations for auto-session creation behavior. The tests were failing because they expected 0 sessions but now get 1 due to auto-creation.

Looking at the current state of project.test.ts, I can see several tests need updates:
1. Tests expecting 0 sessions should expect 1 (auto-created default session)
2. Session creation tests need provider configuration for auto-created sessions to work properly
3. Tests creating projects without provider config may fail when auto-session creation tries to spawn agents

The main architectural insight is that Project.create() auto-creates a default session, but that session needs provider configuration from the project to spawn its coordinator agent successfully.

Key files involved:
- src/projects/project.test.ts - needs test expectation updates
- src/projects/project.ts - Project.create() auto-creates sessions
- src/sessions/session.ts - Session.create() gets effective config from project
