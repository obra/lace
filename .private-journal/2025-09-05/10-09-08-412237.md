## Project Notes

Jesse's API Design Corrections:

1. Per-server endpoints not monolithic blobs:
   - /api/projects/$id/mcp/servers/$serverId (not servers endpoint that manages all)
   - Proper REST resource design
   
2. Projects DO need MCP config methods - I was wrong to say they shouldn't
   - Projects need to manage their MCP configurations
   - Config system handles file details
   - Projects provide high-level operations

Need to design:
- Proper RESTful endpoints for individual server management
- Project methods for MCP config changes (high-level, delegates to config system)
- Clear separation: config system = file operations, projects = business logic
