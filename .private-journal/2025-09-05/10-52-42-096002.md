## Project Notes

Jesse's Clarification on MCP API Scoping:

Configuration endpoints:
- Global: /api/mcp/configuration (manages ~/.lace/mcp-config.json)
- Project: /api/projects/$projectId/mcp/configuration (manages {project}/.lace/mcp-config.json)

Control endpoints:
- Session: /api/projects/$projectId/sessions/$sessionId/mcp/servers/$serverId/control

Tool authorization: Uses existing tool authorization UI (not MCP-specific)

This makes perfect sense:
- Config = what servers are available (global/project level)
- Control = what servers are running (session level)
- Authorization = existing system handles MCP tools like any other tools

Much cleaner separation of concerns.
