## Project Notes

Jesse's Design Insight - Proper Abstraction Levels

Projects want high-level MCP server operations:
- project.startMCPServer(serverId)
- project.getMCPServers() 
- project.updateMCPServerPolicy(serverId, toolId, policy)

NOT low-level config operations:
- project.getMCPConfiguration()
- project.updateMCPConfiguration()

Config system should handle:
- File loading/saving 
- Validation
- Merging global + project configs
- Path resolution

Global API question: Where do system-wide MCP operations live?
- Global MCP server management?
- Cross-project MCP operations? 
- Probably in a high-level MCP service class
