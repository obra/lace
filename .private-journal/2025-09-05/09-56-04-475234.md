## Project Notes

Jesse's Architectural Corrections:

1. MCPService location: Maybe src/tools/ since it's tool-related
2. Global MCP is only CONFIGURATION, not running servers. Servers run per session.
3. No service pattern in lace core - that's only in web interface

Key insight: MCP servers run per SESSION, not globally or per project:
- Global config: defines available MCP servers (like templates)
- Project config: project-specific MCP server definitions/overrides
- Session: actually runs the MCP servers for that conversation

This means:
- Global MCP management = configuration only (no start/stop)
- Project MCP = configuration only (no start/stop)  
- Session MCP = actual running servers (start/stop/restart)

Architecture should be:
- Config system: handles global/project config files
- Session: runs MCP servers for conversations
- Projects: maybe just config delegation, or maybe nothing?
