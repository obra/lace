## Project Notes

Jesse's Clear Direction on Migration Strategy:

1. Burn old APIs to the ground - no compatibility needed since nothing is pushed to GitHub yet
2. Comprehensive integration testing (A) - span the full system  
3. Reuse good core infrastructure, rework web APIs and integration
4. Commit fully to new approach (C) - no rollback strategy needed
5. End-to-end validation (A) - prove the actual issue is fixed

This simplifies everything significantly:
- No backward compatibility concerns
- No gradual migration strategy  
- Can completely replace broken implementation
- Focus on proving the new architecture works end-to-end
