## Project Notes

The async-routes worktree appears to be working on fixing routing issues. The logs show:
- Session reconstruction completes successfully 
- Agent gets created with session ID lace_20250906_g218ks
- Provider creation fails: "Provider instance not found: test-provider"
- Agent initialization marked incomplete due to missing provider
- Browser immediately starts polling for agent data but agent isn't in registry yet

Need to look at:
1. How agents get registered in the AgentManager/registry
2. When API routes check for agent availability 
3. Whether there's proper async coordination between agent init and route availability
