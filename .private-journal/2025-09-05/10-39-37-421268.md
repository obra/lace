## Project Notes

Jesse's Clarifications for Task 1.2:

1. ToolExecutor → Agent → Session → MCPServerManager (existing relationship chain)
2. Agent creation already established (no changes needed)  
3. Error recovery: wait for explicit restart (no automatic retry)

This simplifies the design significantly:
- No ToolExecutor constructor changes needed
- Use existing Agent → Session relationship  
- Session manages MCPServerManager
- ToolExecutor queries via: this.agent?.getSession()?.getMCPServerManager()
- No automatic error recovery complexity

Clean delegation through existing object relationships.
