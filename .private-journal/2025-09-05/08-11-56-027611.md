## Project Notes

Critical Integration Question - MCP Tools in Tool Configuration

Jesse added an MCP server successfully and it's running, but MCP tools aren't showing up in session/workspace tool configuration. This suggests potential gaps:

1. MCP tools might not be integrated with the existing tool configuration system
2. Tool configuration UI might only show native tools, not MCP tools
3. There might be a disconnect between ToolExecutor's MCP tool registration and the configuration interface
4. Session/project tool lists might need to be updated to include MCP tools

This is exactly the kind of integration gap that can happen when you focus on individual components but miss the system-wide integration points.
