## Project Notes

Jesse asking about adding NEW MCP servers at project level. The current design only shows updating/deleting existing servers. Need to add method for creating new servers in project config.

Should be something like:
- addMCPServer(serverId, serverConfig) 
- Need to check for duplicates
- Need to emit appropriate events
- Delegates to config system for actual saving
