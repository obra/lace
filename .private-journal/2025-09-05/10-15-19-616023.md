## Project Notes

Missing Config System Changes from Task 1.1:

Jesse pointed out I dropped the config backend fixes we discussed:

1. Move MCP config files from src/mcp/ to src/config/
2. Add MCP event types to threads/types.ts (MCP_CONFIG_CHANGED, etc.)  
3. Update imports throughout codebase after file moves
4. Enhance MCPConfigLoader with validation that disables broken servers
5. Update config system to validate on load and save

I only showed the Project class changes but ignored all the foundational config system work needed to support those changes.
