## Project Notes

Jesse's Insight - Projects Don't Need ToolExecutors

Projects are configuration containers, not runtime environments. They don't have conversations, don't run tools, don't need tool discovery.

Project configuration API should show:
- What MCP servers are configured for this project
- What tool policies are set for those servers  
- NOT what tools are currently discoverable from running servers

Only Sessions need ToolExecutors because:
- Sessions have conversations
- Sessions run MCP servers
- Sessions discover tools from running servers
- Agents in sessions execute tools

This massively simplifies the design:
- Project API: Show configured servers/policies (static config)
- Session API: Show actual running tools (dynamic discovery)
- No ToolExecutor creation needed in project APIs
