## Project Notes

We fixed the concurrent reconstruction race, but there's still a deeper issue with agent availability. The error shows "Available agents: " (empty), which means:

1. Session reconstruction completes
2. But no agents are found in session.getAgents()
3. This could be because agent creation is failing silently
4. Or agents are created but not properly registered

Need to check:
- Is the coordinator agent actually being created and added to _agents map?
- Is there an error during agent creation that we're not seeing?
- Is the agent created but in a non-functional state?
