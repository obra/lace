## Project Notes

Jesse's asking what Phase 4 actually IS, and reminding me of the core principles: TDD, YAGNI, DRY.

Phase 4 should be the actual implementation of the design we've planned:
- Tasks 1.1-1.2: Config system and core integration changes
- Tasks 1.3-1.6: Web API endpoints  
- Task 2.1: ToolExecutor fixes

With TDD approach:
- Write failing tests first
- Implement minimal code to pass tests  
- Refactor
- Commit frequently

YAGNI: Only implement what's needed, don't add extra features
DRY: Reuse existing patterns and code
