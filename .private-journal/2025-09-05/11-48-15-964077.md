## Project Notes

Rereading MCP Web API Rebuild Plan - Issues I Notice:

1. **Complexity**: Very detailed plan with many interdependent tasks
2. **File moves**: Moving config files might break existing functionality  
3. **Multiple API layers**: Global, Project, Session APIs might be over-engineered
4. **Event system integration**: Adding new event types might be unnecessary complexity
5. **ToolExecutor changes**: Major refactoring of working ToolExecutor code
6. **Test complexity**: Integration tests are quite complex with real MCP servers

Potential YAGNI violations:
- Do we need ALL these API layers?
- Is the event system integration necessary?
- Are we over-engineering the separation between config/runtime?

Potential DRY issues:
- Duplicating validation across multiple API endpoints
- Similar patterns repeated in global/project/session APIs
