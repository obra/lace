## Project Notes

Jesse's Corrections on Event System and Method Naming:

1. Events: USE existing LaceEvent system in threads/types.ts, don't create new event patterns
2. Method names: Keep simple - loadConfig not loadConfigSafe, validateConfig not validateAndDisableInvalid
3. File organization: Move config parts to config/, some things might belong in tools/
4. Error strategy: Disable only broken servers, not all
5. Validation: On both load and save operations

Need to:
- Study LaceEvent pattern in threads/types.ts
- Understand global event system usage
- Keep method names simple and focused
- Properly factor between config/ and tools/ directories
- Use existing validation patterns
