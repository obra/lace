## Project Notes

This is a perfect example of TDD in action. We've identified the root cause (concurrent session reconstruction), now we need to write a test that fails with the current implementation and will pass once we implement the deduplication fix.

The test should be in the session.ts test file and should simulate the exact scenario: multiple concurrent getById calls before any reconstruction completes.
