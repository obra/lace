## Project Notes

Jesse's Design Decisions for Task 1.2:

1. MCP servers start eagerly - needed for tool discovery
2. Session-level MCPServerManager shared by all agents' ToolExecutors
3. Config changes: only restart servers that were specifically changed (not all servers)
4. Session methods should delegate to MCPServerManager, not duplicate functionality:
   - Keep: start/stop/restart/getStatus methods (delegate to manager)
   - Remove: getAllStatuses, getMCPTools (other components query manager directly)

Clean delegation pattern: Session → MCPServerManager → actual server operations
ToolExecutor queries MCPServerManager directly for tool discovery
