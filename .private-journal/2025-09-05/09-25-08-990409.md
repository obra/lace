## Project Notes

Jesse's Corrections on Task 1.1 Design:

1. MCP config should be in config/ not mcp/ (better organization)
2. MCPConfigLoader already handles project config files - don't reimplement in Project class
3. My proposed code has repetition instead of good factoring 
4. Change notification: use existing event system, don't roll custom
5. Validation: should be centralized in MCP config system, not duplicated
6. Error handling: disable broken servers instead of failing

The correct approach:
- Move MCPConfigLoader to config/ directory 
- Project class should delegate to MCPConfigLoader, not reimplement
- Use event system for change notifications
- Centralize validation in config system
- Graceful degradation for invalid servers

I was falling into the trap of reimplementing existing functionality instead of properly factoring and reusing.
