## Project Notes

This is a critical startup flow issue affecting all sessions. The pattern is:
- Session reconstruction completes
- Browser immediately starts polling for agent data
- But agents aren't actually registered/available yet
- Results in 404s across the board

This suggests the session service or agent registration process has an async gap that's not being properly awaited. The "Session reconstruction complete" log might be premature - the session claims to be ready but the agents aren't actually available to serve requests yet.
