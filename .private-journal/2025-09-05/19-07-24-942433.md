## Project Notes

Key insight from Jesse: Users need to access agents with bad providers to fix them. The provider failure is not the root cause - it's just what made the timing issue visible in this particular case.

The real issue is that "Session reconstruction complete" gets logged and the session is marked as ready before agents are actually available to serve API requests. There's an async gap somewhere in the registration/availability process that needs to be identified and fixed.
