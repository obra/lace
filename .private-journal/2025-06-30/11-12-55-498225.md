## Project Notes

Analyzing timeline visual improvement request. Jesse wants custom side markers for TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox that show tool execution status with colors. Current system uses Ink borders but those draw full boxes, not just side characters.

Current rendering flow:
Timeline -> TimelineItem -> TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox -> CollapsibleBox

Need to bypass CollapsibleBox's border system and create custom side marker rendering. The theme system is well-structured with UI_SYMBOLS and UI_COLORS, so extension should be straightforward.

Key requirements from screenshot analysis:
1. Replace forced 3-line minimum with single "C" character for 1-line content
2. Custom side markers for multi-line content  
3. Color-coded status: grey, yellow, green, red
4. Selection state affects brightness (bright when selected, dark when not)

This is a visual enhancement that improves tool execution feedback.
