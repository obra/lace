HEIGHT MEASUREMENT ISSUE ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**The Problem:**
The setTimeout(50) removal in useTimelineViewport.ts:100 broke the timing coordination between DOM measurement and position recalculation. Here's what happens:

**Before the fix (working):**
1. User expands/collapses timeline item → triggerRemeasurement() called
2. setItemToReselectAfterMeasurement(currentSelectedItemIndex) remembers which item was selected  
3. Measurement useEffect runs, measures new DOM heights, updates itemPositions
4. Reselection useEffect runs, calculates newItemStart = itemPositions[itemToReselectAfterMeasurement]  
5. setSelectedLine(newItemStart) updates cursor position
6. setTimeout(() => setItemToReselectAfterMeasurement(-1), 50) - **KEY TIMING**
7. After 50ms, flag is reset, allowing future remeasurements

**After the fix (broken):**
1-5. Same as above
6. setItemToReselectAfterMeasurement(-1) - **IMMEDIATE RESET**

**Why this breaks delegate timelines specifically:**
- Delegate timelines are embedded inside collapsed items  
- When expanded, they need to measure their own content AND coordinate with parent timeline
- The immediate flag reset happens before the delegate's embedded TimelineDisplay has finished its own measurement cycle
- This causes the delegate timeline to have incorrect item positions, leading to cursor jumping to wrong lines

**The Race Condition:**
The measurement process is: DOM render → measureElement() → itemPositions update → cursor positioning
But now the flag reset happens synchronously in the same React render cycle, before the DOM has actually completed the measurement of nested delegate content.

**Solution needed:**
Replace the setTimeout with a more reliable coordination mechanism that ensures measurement completion without arbitrary delays.
