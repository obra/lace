## Project Notes

DEBUGGING THE MISSING REMEASUREMENT TRIGGER

The debug panel shows "Measurement Trigger: 0" even after multiple expansions, which means `triggerRemeasurement()` is never being called. This indicates our `TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox` fix isn't working.

**Key insight from debug panel:**
- Updates: 25 (viewport is updating)  
- Measurement Trigger: 0 (triggerRemeasurement never called)
- Total Height: 24 (stays same, not recalculating)

**Possible issues:**
1. **TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox isn't being used** - Maybe components use different collapsible mechanisms
2. **onToggle prop isn't being passed** - The trigger function isn't reaching the component
3. **useEffect isn't firing** - Our expansion detection logic has a bug
4. **Wrong component is expanding** - Maybe CollapsibleBox itself handles expansion, not TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox

**Next steps:**
1. Check what components actually handle the expansion that Jesse is triggering
2. Verify the onToggle prop is being passed correctly
3. Add logging to see if our useEffect is even running
4. Check if there are multiple collapsible mechanisms in the codebase
