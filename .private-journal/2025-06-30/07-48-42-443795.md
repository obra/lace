## Project Notes

DEBUGGING THE REAL HEIGHT MEASUREMENT ISSUE

I made an error in my analysis. Let me trace through the actual data flow:

**Current Working Flow:**
1. User presses arrow key in timeline
2. `TimelineDisplay.handleItemInteraction()` calls `emitExpand()` or `emitCollapse()`
3. `useTimelineItemExpansion()` hook receives the event (only if `isSelected=true`)
4. Hook calls `expand()` or `collapse()` which calls `onExpansionChange?.(true/false)`
5. `onExpansionChange` is `(expanded) => onToggle?.()` from AgentMessageDisplay.tsx:37
6. `onToggle` is the `triggerRemeasurement` function from the viewport

**My Previous Fix:**
I changed the flag reset in `useTimelineViewport` from immediate to `Promise.resolve().then()`, which should allow nested measurements to complete.

**The Issue Jesse Mentioned:**
"When *any* TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox is opened, we don't properly remeasure"

This suggests the remeasurement IS being triggered, but it's not working correctly. The issue might be:

1. **Timing Issue**: My Promise.resolve() fix might not be sufficient for complex nested content
2. **Measurement Issue**: The measureElement() calls might not be getting updated DOM heights
3. **State Update Issue**: The itemPositions might not be updating correctly
4. **Selection Issue**: The cursor might not be repositioning correctly after height changes

Given that the remeasurement trigger chain looks correct, the issue is likely in the measurement or positioning logic itself, not in the trigger mechanism.

Let me check if there are any React lifecycle issues with the measurement timing.
