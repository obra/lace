## Project Notes

**Key insight about temp dir stability:**

Jesse's right - if we use predictable paths with tmpdir() + sessionId, they'll be stable across session object recreation. The cache was unnecessary complexity.

**New approach:**
- `tmpdir()/lace-session-{sessionId}/tool-call-{toolCallId}/`
- No cache needed - just check if directory exists, create if not
- Sessions can be destroyed/recreated but temp dirs persist until process ends or explicit cleanup
- Much simpler implementation

This is classic YAGNI - we were over-engineering with the cache when the filesystem itself provides the persistence we need.
