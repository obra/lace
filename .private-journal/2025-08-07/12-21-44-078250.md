## Project Notes

**Jesse spotted bad naming in the plan:**

"getLastContext()" is a confusing method name for test mock objects. It's a testing utility method that stores and returns the context that was passed to the tool during the most recent execution.

**Better names:**
- `getReceivedContext()` - clearer about what it contains
- `getCapturedContext()` - indicates it was captured for testing
- `getExecutionContext()` - describes what context it represents

The method is used in tests to verify that the ToolExecutor properly passed temp directory info to tools. It's a test helper, not part of the production Tool interface.
