## Project Notes

## Dead Code Elimination Project - Completion

Just finished the comprehensive dead code elimination project for Lace. The project grew beyond simple dead code removal into completing a critical API migration that was blocking progress.

### What we achieved:
1. **Massive dead code removal**: ~1,425+ lines removed including entire files, unused functions, and dependencies
2. **Critical API migration completion**: Fully migrated from old provider API (provider/model) to new provider instance system (providerInstanceId/modelId)
3. **Test infrastructure cleanup**: Consolidated and improved test utilities, removed 5 unused test files
4. **Interface alignment**: Resolved naming conflicts between core and web package AgentResponse interfaces

### Key technical breakthrough:
The biggest challenge was discovering that we needed to complete the provider instance API migration (PR #122) that was partially implemented but not finished. Tests were failing because:
- Core code was updated to new API but web package still used old field names
- Tests expected old field names but got new ones
- API routes returned old field names instead of new ones

### Final state:
- All 1376 core tests passing (112 test files)  
- All 776 web package tests passing (87 test files)
- Clean git history with meaningful commits
- Knip configuration working properly
- ESLint configuration updated to handle knip.config.ts

### Code quality improvements:
- Removed ~1,425+ lines of dead code
- Eliminated 4 unused dependencies from package.json
- Un-exported 9 internal-only HAR type definitions
- Consolidated duplicate interfaces
- Improved test utility architecture

The codebase is now significantly cleaner and the provider instance system migration is complete.
