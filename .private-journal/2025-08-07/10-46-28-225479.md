## Project Notes

**Current Problem: Bash Tool Output Management**

The bash tool in Lace returns unlimited stderr/stdout which causes:
- Blown token windows on large outputs (like test runs)
- Model overwhelm with response data
- Loss of actual meaningful information in noise

**Key Requirements for Solution:**
1. Agent can still run tools effectively
2. No output is lost (complete audit trail)
3. Model doesn't get overwhelmed with response data
4. Maintains usability for debugging/inspection

**Current Architecture Context:**
- Event-sourcing system means all tool results become TOOL_RESULT events
- These get persisted to SQLite and reconstructed for conversation history
- UI layer (TerminalInterface) processes these events for display
- Agent processes conversation history that includes all tool results

**Design Considerations:**
- Truncation strategies (head/tail, smart truncation)
- Separate storage for full output vs summary for model
- Streaming/progressive disclosure
- Context-aware output filtering
- Post-processing pipeline for tool results
