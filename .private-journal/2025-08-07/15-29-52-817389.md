## Project Notes

Just completed the comprehensive dead code elimination project for Lace. Here's what we achieved:

## Major Dead Code Removed
1. **Files completely removed (~1,425+ lines total)**:
   - `src/sessions/provider-resolution.ts` (162 lines) - unused provider resolution utilities  
   - `src/providers/index.ts` (9 lines) - unused barrel export
   - `src/tools/temp-utils.ts` - consolidated functions into test-utils
   - 5 test utility files in `src/test-utils/` (~1,172 lines): delegation-mock-provider.ts, delegation-msw-helper.ts, global-test-setup.ts, msw-provider-helper.ts, slow-mock-provider.ts

2. **Functions removed from files**:
   - LMStudio converter functions from `format-converters.ts` (82 lines)
   - `formatTokenCount` from `token-estimation.ts`
   - `disable/check` functions from node-fetch-interceptor and websocket-interceptor

3. **Dependencies cleaned up**:
   - Removed from package.json: commander, dotenv, glob, @types/marked-terminal
   - Kept: @anthropic-ai/sdk, playwright (confirmed still needed)

4. **Type definitions cleaned up**:
   - Un-exported 9 HAR type interfaces from `har-recorder.ts` (made internal-only)
   - Renamed core `AgentResponse` to `AgentMessageResult` and made internal-only to resolve naming conflicts with web package

## Key Patterns Learned
- **Un-export vs Delete**: When code is used internally, un-export rather than delete
- **Knip configuration**: Needed to properly scope analysis to avoid false positives (excluded packages/web)
- **Systematic approach**: Files → functions → types → dependencies works well
- **Architecture improvements**: Consolidating test utilities improved separation of concerns

## Project Impact
- Significant reduction in codebase size while maintaining all functionality
- Eliminated naming conflicts between core and web package interfaces
- Improved test utility architecture
- All tests still pass after comprehensive cleanup

The codebase is now much cleaner with better separation between public APIs and internal implementation details.
