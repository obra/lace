## Project Notes

**Jesse's corrections are spot-on:**

1. **Sessions without projects can't happen** - This means the fallback to `getProcessTempDir()` in `Session.getSessionTempDir()` is dead code that should be removed.

2. **ToolExecutor should provide temp dir to tools** - Much better design:
   - ToolExecutor already has session context
   - ToolExecutor can generate the tool call ID 
   - ToolExecutor can pass the temp directory to the tool as part of context
   - Tool base class doesn't need to know about Session or temp directory logic
   - Better separation of concerns

**Current problematic design:**
```
Tool calls Session.getSessionTempDir() 
Tool generates its own tool call ID
Tool creates its own temp directories
```

**Better design:**
```
ToolExecutor has session context
ToolExecutor generates tool call ID
ToolExecutor gets session temp dir
ToolExecutor passes temp dir to tool in context
Tool just uses the provided temp dir
```
