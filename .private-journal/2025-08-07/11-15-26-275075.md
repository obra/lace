## Project Notes

**tmpdir() behavior insight:**

Jesse's right - tmpdir() can return different paths on different calls or systems. We need a stable base directory that persists across process restarts and session recreations.

**Better approach:**
- Use a fixed global lace temp directory (maybe in ~/.lace/temp or similar)
- Structure: `{laceTemp}/project-{projectId}/session-{sessionId}/tool-call-{toolCallId}/`
- This way temp dirs are stable across process restarts and session object recreation
- Also provides better organization by project

This follows the pattern of other lace directories like ~/.lace/config, ~/.lace/data, etc.
