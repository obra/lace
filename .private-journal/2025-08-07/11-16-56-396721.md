## Project Notes

**Ah! Process-scoped temp directories:**

Jesse wants tmpdir() but stable for one server runtime. This means we want to create one base temp directory at process start and reuse it throughout the process lifetime.

**Approach:**
- Create a process-global temp dir on first access: `tmpdir()/lace-runtime-{processId}-{timestamp}/`
- All sessions/projects/tool-calls use subdirectories under this stable base
- When process ends, OS cleans up the temp directory
- Different process runs get different temp dirs (which is good for isolation)

This gives us:
- Stable paths within one server runtime
- Automatic cleanup when process ends
- Isolation between different server runs
- Uses standard tmpdir() as Jesse wanted
