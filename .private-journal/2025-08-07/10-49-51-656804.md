## Project Notes

**Scale of the Problem: 800k stderr**

This is massive - that's roughly 200,000+ tokens just from stderr of a single test run. This would:
- Completely blow out any model's context window 
- Make conversation history reconstruction impossible
- Cost huge amounts in API calls
- Make the tool essentially unusable for test debugging

**Real-World Context:**
- Claude's context is ~200k tokens total
- A single `npm test` in debug mode could use 4x the entire context window
- This isn't just "large output" - this is "completely breaks the system" large

**Critical Design Insight:**
The bash tool result that goes into conversation history MUST be fundamentally different from the complete output. This isn't about truncation - it's about creating a completely different representation for the model vs audit trail.
