## Project Notes

Successfully fixed all remaining thread ID validation issues in the web package:

**Fixed files:**
- `/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/route.test.ts` - Replaced `asThreadId('non_existent')` calls with raw strings
- `/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/configuration/route.ts` - Added proper thread ID validation like other routes
- `/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/configuration/route.test.ts` - Fixed tests to expect 400 for invalid IDs, 404 for valid non-existent IDs
- `/lib/server/session-service-task-events.test.ts` - Fixed thread IDs in task contexts and test data

**Key changes:**
1. API routes now consistently validate thread ID format and return 400 for invalid formats
2. Tests use raw invalid strings (not asThreadId) to test validation
3. Tests use proper thread ID format for contexts that flow through to thread ID fields
4. All session-related tests now pass (49/49)

The approach ensures consistent error handling across the API surface while maintaining proper type safety.
