## Project Notes

The test failures seem to be concentrated around:
1. Configuration route tests failing because they can't find Session.getById 
2. Thread messaging tests failing 
3. The core issue seems to be that I removed methods from SessionService but didn't properly account for all the dependencies

I need to:
1. Identify all the failing tests systematically
2. Understand what functionality I broke
3. Fix each one methodically
4. Make sure I'm not just applying band-aids but actually fixing the root cause

The SessionService tests themselves pass, which means the cleanup worked, but I broke other parts of the system that depended on the removed functionality.
