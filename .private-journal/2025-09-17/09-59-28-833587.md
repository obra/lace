## Project Notes

From the git status and recent work:
- I was working on fixing tool approval architecture issues
- Jesse asked me to commit all outstanding changes in SMALL, ATOMIC commits before proceeding with new architecture
- I need to continue this task - there are still uncommitted files that need to be grouped logically and committed separately
- The goal is to have a clean git history before implementing the Event-First Stateless Approval Architecture
