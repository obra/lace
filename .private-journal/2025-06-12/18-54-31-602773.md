## Project Notes

Found remaining assignedModel/assignedProvider references in:
- test/test-harness.ts - TestHarness still uses old pattern
- src/agents/agent.ts:1682 - chooseAgentForTask has old logic
- test/with-mocks/unit/dual-logging-integration.test.js - missed some references
- test/with-mocks/unit/agents.test.ts - old agent creation 
- test/no-mocks/integration/ files - integration tests expect old properties
- test/with-mocks/unit/agent-activity-logging.test.js - missed some references

Need to fix ALL of these systematically, not just the ones that cause TypeScript errors.
