## Project Notes

The model refactoring is mostly complete but there are still JavaScript test files using the old Agent constructor API:
- test/with-mocks/unit/dual-logging-integration.test.js (8+ instances)
- test/with-mocks/unit/error-recovery-retry.test.js 
- test/with-mocks/unit/agent-activity-logging.test.js
- test/with-mocks/__mocks__/agent.js

All of these need to be updated to use the new required `model` parameter in Agent constructors. Need to create a mockModelInstance factory for JavaScript files and systematically update each file.
