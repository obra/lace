## Project Notes

Looking at the test files I just read:
- packages/web/app/api/projects/[projectId]/sessions/route.test.ts - uses parseResponse correctly 
- packages/web/app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.test.ts - uses parseResponse correctly
- packages/web/app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.integration.test.ts - uses parseResponse correctly, but has one line 192 that uses response.json() directly instead of parseResponse
- packages/web/app/api/threads/[threadId]/approvals/pending/route.test.ts - uses parseResponse correctly
- packages/web/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/configuration/route.test.ts - uses parseResponse correctly

So there's at least one issue in the integration test on line 192. I need to run tests to see what's failing and fix them.
