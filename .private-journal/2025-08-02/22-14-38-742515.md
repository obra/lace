## Project Notes

Found additional manual date serialization instances in API routes:

**Problematic files with manual .toISOString() conversions:**
- packages/web/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/route.ts (lines 49, 56, 141, 148)
- packages/web/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/history/route.ts (line 61)  
- packages/web/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/agents/route.ts (lines 79, 88, 136)
- packages/web/app/api/agents/[agentId]/route.ts (lines 55, 127)
- packages/web/app/api/threads/[threadId]/message/route.ts (lines 101, 126)

These are manually converting Date objects to strings before passing to superjson responses, which is redundant and reduces type safety. Superjson handles Date serialization automatically while preserving types on the client side.

**Impact:** Mixed serialization approach creates inconsistency and potential type safety issues. All of these could be cleaned up to let superjson handle the date serialization automatically.
