## Project Notes

Mixed serialization approach found in serializeTask: The code manually converts dates to strings AND uses superjson. This is redundant and potentially confusing. Superjson handles date serialization automatically while preserving type safety. The manual approach creates a SerializedTask type with string dates which reduces type safety.

This seems like it could be cleaned up, but it's a larger architectural decision that might affect existing client code expectations. Would need Jesse's input on whether to remove the manual serialization and just rely on superjson's automatic date handling.
