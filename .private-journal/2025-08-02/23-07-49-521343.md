## Project Notes

Need to review API error handling consistency across all endpoints. I can see there are multiple API routes in the packages/web/app/api/ structure. The files I've already examined (like sessions/[sessionId]/history/route.ts) show proper usage of createErrorResponse with structured error codes. I need to check other endpoints to ensure they follow the same pattern.
