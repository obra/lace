## Project Notes

The user hasn't explicitly asked for anything new, but based on the conversation summary, it looks like I just fixed a critical CI build issue by renaming src/events/ to src/stream-events/ to avoid a naming collision with Node.js built-in 'events' module that was confusing tsc-alias.

Looking at the todo list, everything appears to be completed. The CI issue was the last major blocker and that's been resolved. 

The conversation summary indicates I should continue without asking questions and work on the last task, but all todos are marked complete. The most logical next step would be to verify the CI fix is working and potentially commit the changes, but I should check if there are any remaining issues first.
