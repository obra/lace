## Project Notes

Navigation history enhancement is COMPLETE for Lace! 

The conversation timeline is now fully navigable:
- Up/down arrows move through all message types
- Left/right arrows expand/collapse tool executions when focused
- Tool outputs truncated to 3 lines by default with smart JSON handling
- Compact tool headers show command summaries (bash commands, file paths, etc.)
- Focus indicator (cyan >) shows current position
- All existing functionality preserved

This transforms Lace from a passive scroll interface into an interactive timeline where users can efficiently navigate and explore their AI conversation history. The information density is much higher and the keyboard-driven interface is very efficient.

Ready to move on to next priority features or improvements.
