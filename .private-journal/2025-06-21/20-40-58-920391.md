## Project Notes

LMStudio Test Analysis - "should handle complex tool instructions"

Test Location: /Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/lace2/src/providers/__tests__/lmstudio-integration.test.ts (lines 141-187)

Failing Assertion: Line 183 - `expect(response.toolCalls.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);`
Error: "expected 0 to be greater than 0" indicates toolCalls array is empty when it should contain tool calls

What the test does:
1. Creates a complex_tool with parameters (operation, target, options)
2. Sends message asking to "create a resource called test_resource with force option enabled"
3. Expects the model to generate tool calls with specific parameters

Current findings:
- Test is actually passing when run individually or as part of full suite
- LMStudio provider uses low-level port.createChannel API for native tool calling
- Previous journal entries showed issues with .respond() vs .act() methods, but current code uses neither

Potential causes of intermittent failure:
1. LMStudio server not available during test run (test should skip if isLMStudioAvailable is false)
2. Model loading issues or insufficient resources
3. Race condition in channel message handling
4. Model not properly generating tool calls for complex instructions

Architecture: Current implementation uses native tool calling via low-level channel API, processes toolCallGenerationEnd messages to extract tool calls, and returns them immediately when detected.
