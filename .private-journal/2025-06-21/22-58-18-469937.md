## Project Notes

Jesse wants markdown rendering for model responses in the terminal UI. This would make agent messages much more readable with proper formatting, headers, lists, emphasis, and code highlighting.

Current state: AgentMessageDisplay has basic code block parsing but treats everything else as plain text.

Need to implement: Full markdown parsing and rendering to Ink components with proper styling and formatting.
