## Project Notes

User wants enhanced tool message display in Lace:
- Truncate tool messages to 3 lines by default
- Up/down arrows for timeline navigation
- Left/right arrows for expand/collapse individual entries
- Potential other UX embellishments

Current codebase uses event-sourcing with React/Ink terminal UI. Clean component structure makes this feasible without major rewrites. Key enhancement areas:
1. Timeline navigation state management
2. Message truncation logic for tool outputs
3. Enhanced keyboard input handling
4. Visual indicators for focused/navigable items

The existing CollapsibleBox and ToolExecutionDisplay components provide good foundation to build upon.
