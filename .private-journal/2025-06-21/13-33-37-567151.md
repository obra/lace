## Project Notes

Delegation UI refactor is now complete! The architecture changes included:

**Core Changes**:
- ThreadProcessor.processThreads() returns separate timelines for main and delegate threads
- Event-level caching for expensive operations (thinking blocks, etc)
- Real-time delegation boxes that appear immediately when delegation starts
- DelegationBox component shows collapsible delegate thread timelines
- Removed redundant "Starting delegation" system messages

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Individual event parsing is cached (expensive part)
- Thread organization and tool pairing happens fresh each time (correctness)
- UI updates reactively via ThreadManager EventEmitter pattern

**Testing Updates**:
- All ThreadProcessor tests updated for new caching behavior
- All DelegateTool tests updated for new thread ID format  
- Delegation integration tests updated to remove system message expectations

**Files Changed** (15 total):
- Core: thread-processor.ts, thread-manager.ts, delegate.ts
- UI: ConversationDisplay.tsx, TimelineDisplay.tsx, DelegationBox.tsx (new)
- Tests: delegation-integration.test.ts (new), thread-processor.test.ts, delegate.test.ts

The delegation workflow now works end-to-end: delegation boxes appear immediately, update live as subagent works, and can be collapsed/expanded. Sub-delegations are supported through recursive delegation boxes.
