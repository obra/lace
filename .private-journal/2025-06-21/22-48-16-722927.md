## Project Notes

Fixed focus management conflict between timeline navigation and tool approval modal!

Issue: Timeline navigation was capturing up/down arrow keys even when the tool approval modal was active, making it impossible to navigate the modal options.

Solution: Implemented proper focus management using Ink's useFocusManager:
- Components now use focusId instead of autoFocus boolean
- Focus automatically switches to approval modal when it appears  
- Focus returns to shell input when modal closes
- Added Tab/Escape shortcuts for manual focus switching
- Timeline navigation only works when timeline component has focus

The navigation system now properly respects Ink's focus management, making it safe to use alongside other interactive components like modals.
