## Project Notes

The original plan needs significant adjustments based on the actual codebase:

**What's Already There:**
- Event-driven architecture ✓
- Token usage tracking ✓  
- Streaming token events ✓
- Agent state management ✓
- SIGINT handling (basic) ✓
- Terminal UI with processing states ✓

**What Needs Building:**
- Turn-based metrics tracking (new concept)
- AbortController integration with providers
- Enhanced Ctrl+C handling (abort vs exit)
- Progress timer for turn elapsed time
- Input protection during processing (React-based, not readline)

**Architecture Changes:**
- Add CurrentTurnMetrics to Agent
- Add abort() method to Agent  
- Add AbortSignal to provider createResponse/createStreamingResponse
- Update terminal interface to show turn progress
- Enhance SIGINT to distinguish abort vs exit

**Provider Signal Support Status:**
- Anthropic: ✓ Confirmed (signal in RequestOptions)
- OpenAI: Likely ✓ (need to verify)
- LMStudio: Unknown (custom channel API)
- Ollama: Unknown (need to check their SDK)

The plan structure is sound but implementation details need updates for the React-based terminal interface rather than readline.
