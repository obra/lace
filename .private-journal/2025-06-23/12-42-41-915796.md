## Project Notes

Successfully completed Phase 1 of turn-by-turn progress tracking implementation for Lace. Following the TDD approach from docs/plans/turn-by-turn.md perfectly:

**Phase 1 Complete: Core Progress Tracking âœ…**
- All 5 tests written and passing
- `CurrentTurnMetrics` interface implemented
- Agent class extended with turn tracking (turn_start, turn_progress, turn_complete events)
- Progress timer working at 1-second intervals
- Unique turn ID generation working
- Turn metrics reset between turns
- No regressions in existing functionality (41 tests still pass)

**Ready for Phase 2: Provider AbortSignal Integration**
Next step is to add AbortSignal support to all providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, LMStudio, Ollama) per the validated plan. All SDKs already confirmed to support AbortSignal.

The event-driven architecture is working beautifully for this feature. Turn tracking integrates seamlessly into Agent's existing conversation processing flow.
