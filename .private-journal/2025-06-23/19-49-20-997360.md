## Project Notes

Phase 5 implementation now complete! Successfully delivered React/Ink interface integration for turn-by-turn progress tracking with all 12 tests passing.

🎯 What Was Delivered:
✅ Real-time progress display in StatusBar with elapsed time and token counts
✅ Input protection during active turns with progress feedback
✅ Turn completion/abort messaging with ephemeral system messages  
✅ Enhanced SIGINT behavior showing progress when aborting
✅ Comprehensive test coverage validating all integration points

🔧 Key Implementation Details:
- Enhanced TerminalInterfaceComponent with currentTurnMetrics state
- StatusBar now shows turn progress when active, session info when idle
- ShellInput placeholder dynamically updates with elapsed time during processing
- Turn lifecycle events properly wired to React state management
- Added turn_progress event handler for real-time updates

📁 Files Modified:
- terminal-interface.tsx: Enhanced with turn state management and progress display
- status-bar.tsx: Added CurrentTurnMetrics integration and dynamic display logic
- phase5-progress-display.test.tsx: Comprehensive 12-test integration suite
- Fixed TypeScript issues in existing tests (requestId, context fields)

🎨 User Experience Improvements:
- Clear visual indication that system is working during processing
- Real-time elapsed time and token count display
- Input automatically disabled during processing with helpful placeholder
- Immediate abort capability with Ctrl+C showing partial progress
- Turn completion messages with performance summary

The React/Ink terminal interface now provides a much more responsive and informative user experience during model processing, eliminating the "wedged" feeling and providing instant feedback.
