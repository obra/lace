## Project Notes

**Final SDK Analysis Results - All Green!**

✅ **Anthropic SDK v0.54.0**: `signal?: AbortSignal` in RequestOptions
✅ **OpenAI SDK v4.104.0**: `signal?: AbortSignal` in RequestOptions  
✅ **LMStudio SDK v1.2.1**: Multiple AbortSignal support + cancel() methods
✅ **Ollama SDK v0.5.16**: AbortableAsyncIterator with abort() method

**Plan Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The turn-by-turn progress tracking and abort mechanism plan is fully validated:
- All providers support cancellation
- Existing Agent architecture is perfect for turn tracking
- React-based terminal interface already has the foundation
- Token usage tracking already exists
- Event-driven architecture already in place

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement CurrentTurnMetrics interface in Agent
2. Add AbortController to Agent._processConversation()
3. Update providers to pass AbortSignal 
4. Enhance terminal interface with turn progress display
5. Update SIGINT handling for abort vs exit

Ready to proceed with TDD implementation following the plan phases.
