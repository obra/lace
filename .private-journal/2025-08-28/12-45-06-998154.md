## Project Notes

## Context Window Debug Issue

Jesse created a project with Kimi K2 model from Groq with catalog showing 131072 context window, but web UI shows 200k. This suggests either:

1. The web UI hasn't picked up our catalog changes yet
2. The web UI is using a different code path 
3. The catalog isn't being loaded properly
4. There's caching happening

Need to debug:
1. Check if web UI builds include our changes
2. Verify the catalog data is being loaded
3. Check what the provider actually returns
4. See if there's a different getAvailableModels path in web UI
