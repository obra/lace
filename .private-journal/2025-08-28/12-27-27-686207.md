## Project Notes

## External Reviewer Feedback Analysis

The reviewer is external and a job candidate, so I need to be careful about which recommendations to implement. Let me analyze each:

**Good recommendations (implement):**
1. Use existing `createModel` helper in base provider - this is good DRY principle
2. Remove type assertions for apiKey - proper type narrowing is better
3. Fix credentials check (undefined vs null) - this is a real bug
4. Add catalog context to metadata providers - makes sense for consistency

**Questionable/risky recommendations (be cautious):**
1. Remove hardcoded 200k fallback and require explicit fallbacks - this could break existing code and the 200k is a reasonable default for most models
2. Make fallback parameters required - this is a breaking API change that adds complexity
3. Async getAvailableProviders() - this would be a major API change affecting many call sites
4. Complete rewrite of getAvailableProviders() - this is a major refactor that could introduce bugs

**Context the reviewer doesn't have:**
- The 200k fallback is actually reasonable for most Claude models
- The current API design is used in many places
- Breaking changes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary
- The hardcoded provider list might exist for good reasons (startup reliability, etc.)

I'll implement the clearly beneficial changes and skip the risky architectural changes that could break existing functionality.
