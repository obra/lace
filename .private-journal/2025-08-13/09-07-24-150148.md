## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to eliminate wrapper response types from the web package API. This is a breaking change to API contracts that needs to be done systematically:

Current wrappers to eliminate:
- SessionsResponse { sessions: SessionInfo[] } → SessionInfo[]
- SessionResponse { session: SessionInfo } → SessionInfo
- AgentResponse { agent: AgentInfo } → AgentInfo
- ProvidersResponse { providers: ProviderInfo[] } → ProviderInfo[]
- ProjectsResponse { projects: ProjectInfo[] } → ProjectInfo[]
- ProjectResponse { project: ProjectInfo } → ProjectInfo
- PendingApprovalsResponse { pendingApprovals: PendingApproval[] } → PendingApproval[]
- SessionHistoryResponse { events: LaceEvent[] } → LaceEvent[]

Keep structured responses that add value:
- MessageResponse { status: 'accepted', threadId, messageId }
- DeleteProjectResponse { success: boolean }
- ToolApprovalResponse { requestId, decision, reason }

Need to:
1. Update API route handlers to return core types directly
2. Update all consumers (hooks, components, tests)
3. Remove wrapper type definitions
4. Replace local duplicated types in test files

Jesse emphasized focusing on one wrapper type at a time, starting with ProjectResponse/ProjectsResponse since duplication has already been identified there.

This requires careful systematic work since it's a breaking change.
