## Project Notes

Looking at the ProjectResponse duplication issue. I can see:

1. Central definition in types/api.ts: `ProjectResponse { project: ProjectInfo }`
2. Multiple test files redefine this as local interfaces with hand-rolled project shapes that mirror ProjectInfo fields
3. Same pattern with ProjectsResponse, ErrorResponse, etc.

This is classic duplication where tests are reimplementing types instead of importing them. The problem is likely that tests were written before the central types existed, or developers didn't know about the central types.

Key files with duplication:
- app/api/projects/route.test.ts - defines ProjectResponse, ProjectsResponse
- app/api/projects/route.integration.test.ts - same
- app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.test.ts - same  
- app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.integration.test.ts - same
- hooks/useEventStream.ts - defines project shape inline
- Various other test files

The cleanup should:
1. Remove all local type definitions that duplicate central types
2. Import central types from @/types/api instead
3. Use ProjectInfo directly where possible instead of wrapping it
4. Consolidate error response patterns

This will reduce maintenance burden and ensure type consistency across the codebase.
