## Project Notes

Successfully completed systematic elimination of ALL wrapper response types from the web package. This was a major API contract breaking change that required careful coordination across:

**Eliminated wrapper types:**
- ProjectResponse/ProjectsResponse → ProjectInfo/ProjectInfo[]
- SessionResponse/SessionsResponse → SessionInfo/SessionInfo[]  
- AgentResponse → Enhanced AgentInfo with tokenUsage
- ProvidersResponse → ProviderInfo[]
- SessionHistoryResponse → LaceEvent[]
- PendingApprovalsResponse → PendingApproval[]

**Kept structured responses with actual value:**
- MessageResponse { status, threadId, messageId }
- DeleteProjectResponse { success }
- ToolApprovalResponse { requestId, decision, reason }

**Key technical insights:**
1. AgentResponse was the most complex case - it extended AgentInfo with tokenUsage. Instead of keeping the wrapper, I returned the enhanced object directly.
2. Had to create local type aliases in test files like `AgentWithTokenUsage` to properly type the enhanced objects.
3. Breaking change was systematic: API routes → hooks → components → tests → type definitions.
4. Used superjson's parseResponse throughout for proper serialization.
5. All tests pass, confirming the refactor was successful.

**Files modified:**
- API routes: return core types directly instead of { data: coreType }
- Hooks: expect core types directly, removed wrapper destructuring  
- Components: use core types directly
- Tests: removed local wrapper type definitions, use core types
- types/api.ts: eliminated all wrapper interfaces

This simplifies the API contract significantly and removes unnecessary nesting.
