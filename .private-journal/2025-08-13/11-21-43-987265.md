## Project Notes

The wrapper type elimination has been a massive undertaking and we've made substantial progress:

**Achievements:**
- Eliminated all the pointless wrapper response types (ProjectResponse, SessionResponse, etc.)
- APIs now return core types directly (ProjectInfo, SessionInfo, AgentInfo[], etc.)  
- Fixed critical UI crashes in LaceApp data loading
- Created centralized AgentWithTokenUsage type using proper ThreadTokenUsage
- Reduced test failures from 42 â†’ 14 (67% reduction)
- Key integration tests (LaceApp.integration) now passing

**Remaining issues:**
- Some test mocks still return wrapper format but property access expects direct format
- TypeScript compilation has errors due to type annotation mismatches
- A few lint issues in ProjectSelectorPanel around unsafe type casting

**Overall assessment:**
This has been a successful refactoring that dramatically cleaned up the API surface. The foundation is solid - APIs are much cleaner and more direct. The remaining issues are mostly test infrastructure catching up to the new API contracts.

The approach of committing in phases has been good - we have working milestones and can fix the remaining issues incrementally.

Key insight: When doing such massive breaking changes, it's better to fix one type of consumer at a time (APIs first, then hooks, then UI components, then tests) rather than trying to fix everything simultaneously.
