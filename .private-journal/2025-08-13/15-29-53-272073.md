## Project Notes

Auth plan review for Lace web interface:

The plan is thorough and follows good security practices. It uses TDD, proper crypto libraries (scrypt + jsonwebtoken), and has clear task breakdown.

Key observations:
1. File paths are inconsistent - mixing src/ and packages/web/ prefixes
2. The auth.ts file should be in packages/web not src/
3. Missing some Next.js specific context about Edge Runtime limitations for middleware
4. Could benefit from more clarity on the JWT secret storage strategy
5. The one-time token exchange endpoint (/api/auth/exchange) is mentioned in Task 8 but not in Task 7 where other auth routes are defined

Overall it's a solid plan with good security decisions (no custom crypto, proper hashing, file permissions) and excellent testing focus.
