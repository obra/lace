## Project Notes

Lace current state vs Claude Code insights:

CURRENT LACE STRENGTHS:
- Good agent orchestration concept with specialized roles
- Tool synthesis already implemented (extractTextFromToolResult, synthesizeToolResponse)
- Multi-generational memory system
- Proper separation of concerns

GAPS IDENTIFIED FROM CLAUDE CODE:
1. UI/UX: We're using basic console.log, they have React-powered terminal UI
2. Context Management: We have basic token counting, they have sophisticated streaming and compression
3. Tool Execution: We have basic approval, they have complex pipeline with synthesis
4. Monitoring: We have verbose logging, they have comprehensive telemetry
5. Performance: We load everything upfront, they have lazy loading and streaming
6. Multi-Provider: We only support Anthropic, they support multiple providers with failover

ACTIONABLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR LACE:
1. Implement streaming tool responses and auto-synthesis for large outputs
2. Add more sophisticated context window management with proactive compression
3. Implement React-based terminal UI for better user experience  
4. Add telemetry and performance monitoring
5. Multi-provider LLM support with intelligent routing
6. Better tool approval system with user preferences learning
