## Project Notes

Core functionality is now working! The CLI successfully:

- Accepts user input
- LLM generates tool calls
- Tool calls go through approval system
- Auto-approved tools execute without prompts
- Results are returned to user

Still need to test interactive prompts manually since that requires human input. The system is ready for real use with proper safety controls in place.
