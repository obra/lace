## Project Notes

Found the root cause of the "sessionId is not defined" error! The issue is in src/agents/agent.js:98 where the approval system is called with sessionId in context, but sessionId is not in scope in generateResponse method. 

The execution flow is:
1. processInput(sessionId, input) - has sessionId
2. calls generateResponse(input) - sessionId NOT passed 
3. generateResponse tries to pass sessionId to approval system - UNDEFINED

Need to fix by passing sessionId to generateResponse method.
