## Project Notes

Working on lace - Jesse's lightweight agentic coding environment project:

**Current State:**
- Successfully implemented comprehensive context window tracking
- Added cost calculation and real-time usage monitoring
- Fixed tool execution infinite loop bug
- Created clean GitHub repo with proper gitignore

**Technical Stack:**
- Node.js with ES modules
- Anthropic SDK for Claude models
- SQLite for conversation persistence
- Inquirer for CLI interface
- Git filter-branch for history cleanup

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Multi-model support with model-specific context windows
- Real-time token usage tracking during streaming
- Cost calculation with pricing database
- Enhanced CLI with /status command
- Tool approval system for safety
- Agentic loop with circuit breaker

**Jesse's Preferences:**
- Prefers simple, pragmatic solutions over complex architectures
- Values real-time feedback and transparency (verbose mode)
- Wants clean git history without sensitive data
- Likes comprehensive status information readily available

**Next Potential Work:**
- Could add context compression when nearing limits
- Might implement automatic model switching based on usage
- Could add cost budgets/alerts
- Repository is ready for public sharing
