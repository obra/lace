## Project Notes

# LACE Project: Current State and Architecture

## Project Overview

Lace is a lightweight agentic coding environment that uses orchestrator-driven agent selection with multi-model support. The goal is to create a self-improving coding assistant that's safer and more efficient than existing tools.

## Revolutionary Architecture Features

### 1. Orchestrator-Driven Model Selection

**Key Innovation**: The calling agent chooses which model to use based on task complexity, not the executing agent.

Benefits:

- Cost optimization (expensive models only when needed)
- Context pollution prevention (subagents return summaries, not full outputs)
- Role clarity (agents know their capabilities)
- Dynamic optimization (right model for right task)

Example:

```javascript
// Orchestrator analyzes: "plan authentication system"
const planningAgent = await this.spawnSubagent({
  role: "planning",
  assignedModel: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", // or 'o3-mini'
  task: "Design authentication system architecture",
});

// Orchestrator analyzes: "list files"
const executionAgent = await this.spawnSubagent({
  role: "execution",
  assignedModel: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022", // fast model
  task: "List files in current directory",
});
```

### 2. Multi-Generational Memory System

**Design**: Keep old agents alive as "memory oracles" instead of losing context.

- **Active Agent**: Current conversation (80% context limit)
- **Memory Agents**: Previous generations available for queries
- **Conversation Database**: Persistent SQLite storage
- **Handoff Process**: Seamless transition with compressed context

### 3. Tool Safety System

**Implementation**: Interactive approval for all tool calls with risk assessment.

Components:

- ToolApprovalManager with interactive prompts
- Auto-approve/deny lists for automation
- Risk assessment (high/medium/low)
- Argument modification before execution
- Post-execution comment injection

## Current Architecture

### Core Classes

```
Lace (main orchestrator)
â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationDB (SQLite persistence)
â”œâ”€â”€ ToolRegistry (extensible tool system)
â”œâ”€â”€ ModelProvider (multi-provider LLM support)
â”œâ”€â”€ ToolApprovalManager (safety system)
â””â”€â”€ Agent (reasoning and execution)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Primary Agent (orchestrator role)
    â””â”€â”€ Subagents (specialized roles)
```

### Tool Ecosystem

- **ShellTool**: Command execution with safety checks
- **FileTool**: Read/write/edit operations
- **JavaScriptTool**: Computational capabilities (secret weapon!)
- **SearchTool**: Content discovery across files

### Agent Roles

- **Orchestrator**: User interaction, task analysis, model selection
- **Planning**: Complex task breakdown (Sonnet/o3)
- **Execution**: Simple operations (Haiku)
- **Reasoning**: Deep analysis and debugging (Sonnet)
- **Memory**: Historical context queries (previous generations)

## Implementation Status

### âœ… COMPLETE

- Orchestrator-driven agent system
- Multi-provider model architecture
- Tool registry with core tools
- Conversation persistence
- Tool approval system (architecture)
- Console interface with commands
- Comprehensive test harness
- CLI with configuration options

### ðŸš¨ CURRENT ISSUES

- Tool approval prompts not appearing
- "sessionId is not defined" errors
- Auto-approve lists not working properly
- Database permission errors in tests
- Tool result processing bugs

### ðŸ“‹ PENDING

- Multi-generational handoff implementation
- OpenAI and local model providers
- Advanced context management
- Self-improvement capabilities

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. JavaScript Evaluation Tool

**Why it's revolutionary**: Makes the agent computational, not just conversational.

- Safe sandboxed execution
- Quick calculations without file I/O
- Data processing capabilities
- Logic validation

### 2. Persistent Memory

**Why it matters**: No other system maintains conversation history across sessions.

- SQLite for reliability
- Queryable conversation history
- Session isolation
- Memory oracle pattern

### 3. Safety-First Approach

**Why it's essential**: Tool execution needs user control.

- Interactive approval by default
- Risk-based assessment
- Configurable automation
- User override capabilities

## File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/          # Agent classes and orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ database/        # SQLite conversation storage
â”œâ”€â”€ interface/       # Console UI and commands
â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # LLM provider abstraction
â”œâ”€â”€ safety/          # Tool approval and risk assessment
â””â”€â”€ tools/           # Extensible tool ecosystem

â”œâ”€â”€ integration/     # System testing
â””â”€â”€ test-harness.js  # Testing utilities
```

## Configuration Options

```bash
# CLI Usage
node src/cli.js --verbose
node src/cli.js --auto-approve javascript_calculate
node src/cli.js --deny shell_execute --no-interactive

# Console Commands
/approval                    # Show current settings
/auto-approve <tool>        # Add to whitelist
/deny <tool>               # Add to blacklist
/tools                     # Show available tools
/memory                    # Show conversation history
```

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Fix Core Tool Execution**: Get approval prompts working
2. **Stabilize Test Suite**: Resolve database and integration issues
3. **Implement Handoff System**: Multi-generational memory
4. **Add Provider Support**: OpenAI and local models
5. **Self-Improvement Features**: Tool creation and codebase modification

## Success Metrics

- Interactive approval prompts appear for all tool calls
- Auto-approve/deny lists work as configured
- All tests pass consistently
- Users feel confident and in control
- Context handoff enables unlimited conversation length

The architecture is sound and revolutionary. The current focus needs to be on making the safety system work reliably.
