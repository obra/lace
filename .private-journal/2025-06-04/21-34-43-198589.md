## Project Notes

## Lace Cost Tracking Investigation Results

**Anthropic API Response Analysis:**
- Usage object only contains `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` counts
- No pricing/cost information in API responses
- Current provider already passes through usage data

**Current Usage Tracking:**
- Agent.js already accumulates tokens across iterations (lines 98-102)
- Usage data flows through the response chain properly
- Foundation exists for adding cost calculations

**Next Steps for Cost Implementation:**
1. Create pricing lookup tables for different models
2. Add cost calculation utilities  
3. Implement database cost tracking
4. Display cost information in UI

The architecture is already set up to support cost tracking - just need to layer on the pricing calculations.
