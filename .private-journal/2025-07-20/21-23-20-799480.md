## Project Notes

Looking at the todo list, I need to continue the systematic Task type migration following the same pattern used for Project types. The user has already seen this work completed for Projects and explicitly requested "make the same changes for Tasks." 

The first pending task is "Find and audit all usages of design system Task type" - I need to search the codebase for Task imports and usage to understand the scope, similar to how I handled Projects.

Key files I've seen that likely use Task types:
- AnimatedLaceApp.tsx (has activeTasks state with Task[])
- Sidebar and MobileSidebar stories
- Various test files
- Type definition files

I should start by searching for Task imports and usage patterns to build a complete picture before making changes.
