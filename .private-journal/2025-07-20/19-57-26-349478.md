## Project Notes

The Phase 2 TimelineView integration is fundamentally broken despite unit tests passing. Multiple critical issues:

- API fixes made but UI still not working
- TimelineView styling/theme conflicts with existing UI
- Agent filtering mechanism not working
- Conversation scrolling broken
- Agent messages not displaying

This suggests the issue isn't just API data format - there's likely:
1. CSS/styling conflicts between design system and existing styles
2. TimelineView component may not be compatible with our data flow
3. Agent filtering logic in the conversion or UI layer broken
4. Container height/overflow issues preventing scrolling

Need to debug the actual rendered output and see what's happening in the browser. The timeline converter unit tests passing but integration failing suggests a gap between unit and integration testing.
