## Project Notes

Just completed D.2 (timestamp standardization) successfully. All SessionEvent timestamp inconsistencies are now resolved. The system now consistently uses Date objects throughout, with backward compatibility maintained via defensive parsing in the timeline converter.

Current status:
✅ D.1: Runtime timestamp fixes - COMPLETED
✅ D.2: Backend timestamp standardization - COMPLETED  
✅ D.3: Remove unused components - COMPLETED

Remaining high priority task is D.5 (end-to-end testing of TimelineView integration). This is critical to validate that our Phase 2 migration actually works in the browser. The dev server is running on port 3005 but I had browser conflicts earlier. 

The core implementation is solid - timeline converter has 15/15 passing tests, API is standardized, unused components removed. But I need to validate the actual user-facing functionality works correctly.
