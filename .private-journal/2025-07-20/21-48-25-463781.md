## Project Notes

Jesse asked me to find and fix test files using old Task mock data format, expecting to need updates from old design system format to core Task format. After thorough analysis:

## Task Migration Status: ALREADY COMPLETE

### Files Analyzed:
- `components/__tests__/TaskDetailModal.test.tsx` ✓ Already updated
- `components/__tests__/TaskList.test.tsx` ✓ Already updated  
- `lib/client/__tests__/task-api.test.ts` ✓ Already updated
- `hooks/__tests__/useTaskManager.test.tsx` ✓ Already updated
- All API route test files ✓ Already updated

### Key Findings:
1. **All Task mock objects already use correct format:**
   - String IDs (e.g., 'task_20240101_abc123') ✓
   - Required fields present: prompt, assignedTo, createdBy, threadId, createdAt, updatedAt, notes ✓
   - Using 'assignedTo' not 'assignee' ✓

2. **No 'review' status found** - no need to change to 'blocked'

3. **Fixed minor compilation issue**: Fixed `mockSession` reference to `mockCoreSession` in notes test file

### Test Results:
- TaskDetailModal: 9 tests passing ✓
- TaskList: 10 tests passing ✓  
- task-api client: 10 tests passing ✓
- useTaskManager: 10 tests passing ✓
- All API route tests: 27 tests passing ✓

The migration work Jesse expected was already completed in previous work sessions. All test files are properly using the core Task format and passing successfully.
