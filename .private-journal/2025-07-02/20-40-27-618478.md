## Project Notes

Tool system refactoring Phase 6 cleanup is now complete. Successfully:

- Migrated all 12 tools to schema-based validation (delegate was the final complex tool)
- Removed all legacy implementations (*-old.ts files) and old BaseTool class
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors using proper assertion patterns
- Updated all test mocks to use new class-based pattern instead of object literals
- Resolved symbol indexing and enum import issues

Next phase is documentation (Phase 7) - need to update CLAUDE.md and README to reflect the new tool architecture. The migration has been successful with clean build and passing tests (1 flaky e2e test unrelated to tool work).
