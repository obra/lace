## Project Notes

Starting Phase 6 cleanup after successful completion of all 12 tool migrations. All tools now use:
- Schema-based validation with Zod
- createResult/createError output helpers  
- Enhanced error messages for AI recovery
- 70%+ code reduction achieved

Next steps for cleanup:
1. Remove old Tool interface from types.ts
2. Update Agent class to use new Tool type
3. Fix remaining executeTool calls in tests
4. Update provider interfaces
5. Run full test suite to verify everything works
