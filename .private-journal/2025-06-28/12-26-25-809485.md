## Project Notes

Fixed the infinite focus loop bug in the Lace focus system. The issue was in focus-provider.tsx line 71 - the useEffect dependency array included `inkFocus` which changes on every render, causing the initial focus to be reset repeatedly and stealing focus back from other components.

Changed from `[inkFocus]` to `[]` to run the initial focus effect only once on mount.

This explains why escape key navigation appeared to work (the focus stack logic was correct) but the timeline component never visually showed as focused - it was getting focus for 1ms before being immediately stolen back.

Still need to test the fix in actual terminal since raw mode errors prevent testing via npm start from non-TTY stdin.
