## Project Notes

Found several categories of potential dead code from the old focus system:

**Dead Props in Tests:**
- Many test files still have `currentFocusId` prop in their mock defaultProps that isn't being used by actual components
- `isFocused` props in test mocks that may not match real component interfaces
- Test components passing focus props that actual implementations no longer use

**Potential Dead Interfaces:**
- Some components still define `isFocused?: boolean` props but may not actually use them in the implementation
- Focus-related props that are defined but never checked or used for actual behavior

**Analysis needed:**
- Need to trace whether `isFocused` props in EventDisplay components are actually doing anything
- Check if focus system files are properly integrated vs just existing
- Look for components receiving focus props but not using them for dimming/highlighting
