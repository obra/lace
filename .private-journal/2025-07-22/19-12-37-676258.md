## Project Notes

Thread isolation bug identified in conversation building:

**Root Cause**: ThreadManager.getMainAndDelegateEvents() has misnamed method call
- Calls `listThreadIdsForSession(mainThreadId)` but passes a thread ID, not session ID
- This semantic mismatch causes wrong threads to be included in conversation history
- Results in 37 messages from other threads contaminating thread lace_20250721_t3tbeg.2

**Fix needed**: Either rename the method or change the implementation to correctly handle thread-based delegation vs session-based delegation.

**Impact**: Agent conversation building gets wrong events, leading to context contamination and potentially confusing responses.

The bug is in line 286 of thread-manager.ts in the getMainAndDelegateEvents method.
