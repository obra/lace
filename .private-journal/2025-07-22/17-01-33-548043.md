## Project Notes

The user has identified a critical bug: the web UI shows agents configured to use "sonnet 4" but the actual provider logs show requests going to "claude-3-haiku-20240307". This is a model selection/configuration bug where the UI settings aren't being properly applied to the actual agent instances.

This suggests there's a disconnect between:
1. The model selection in the web UI
2. How that model config gets stored/persisted 
3. How agents get instantiated with the correct model

Need to trace the flow:
- UI model selection → API calls → Agent creation/configuration → Provider calls
- Check if the model is being saved correctly
- Check if agents are reading the correct model config
- Check if there's a fallback/default happening somewhere

The session ID is lace_20250721_t3tbeg and it should be using sonnet 4 but is using haiku instead.
