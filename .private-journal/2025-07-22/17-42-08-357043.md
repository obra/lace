## Project Notes

Jesse found that despite the API returning the correct models (controller: claude-sonnet-4-20250514, agent 2: claude-3-sonnet-20241022), the actual provider calls are still using claude-3-haiku-20240307. This means the metadata is correct but the actual agent instances are somehow configured with the wrong model.

He's asking me to look for "architectural fuckups" from when agents were disentangled from sessions and sessions became part of projects. This suggests there was a major refactoring that may have left some inconsistencies.

Key issues to investigate:
1. Agent.createSession() method in agent.ts that shouldn't be there
2. How agent instances get their provider configuration vs metadata
3. Session restoration and agent initialization flow
4. Project -> Session -> Agent hierarchy and how models flow through it

The real issue is likely that when agents are restored/initialized, they're getting provider instances with hardcoded defaults instead of the configured models from the metadata.
