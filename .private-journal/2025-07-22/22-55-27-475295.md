## Project Notes

From git status, I can see there are several categories of changes:
1. Debug logging changes to various files (sessions/session.ts, tools/executor.ts, tools/implementations/bash.ts, tools/tool.ts, tools/implementations/file-list.ts)
2. Test files modifications 
3. Package files (package.json, package-lock.json)
4. Untracked files including test script

I should group these logically - debug logging in one commit, test changes in another, etc.
