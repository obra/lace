## Project Notes

## Current Project State - Lace Web Application

### Recently Completed Work
1. **E2E Test Fixes**: Fixed all Playwright tests for hash-based URL persistence (5/6 passing, 1 skipped due to hash routing limitation)
2. **UI Improvements**: Fixed agent edit refresh, moved buttons, standardized icons, corrected agent counts
3. **Backend Optimization**: Added efficient database methods for fetching threads by project/session

### Architecture Notes
- **Event-sourcing foundation** with SQLite persistence and graceful degradation
- **Three-layer system**: Data (ThreadManager/Persistence) → Logic (Agent/Tools) → Interface (Terminal/Web/API)
- **Hash-based routing** for client-side navigation with known limitation for browser back/forward
- **Project-Session-Agent hierarchy** properly maintained throughout API and database layers

### Database Layer Structure
- `DatabasePersistence` class in `/src/persistence/database.ts`
- New efficient methods: `getThreadsByProject`, `getThreadsBySession`, `getThreadCountBySession`
- Proper code duplication reduction with private `executeThreadQuery` helper
- Graceful degradation when SQLite is disabled

### Web API Structure  
- RESTful hierarchy: `/api/projects/[projectId]/sessions` 
- Session list includes `agentCount` for efficient rendering
- Project class methods handle business logic, persistence methods handle data access
- Proper TypeScript validation with Zod schemas

### Current Branch: f/new-ui
- All major functionality working properly
- Performance optimizations completed
- Ready for production deployment
