## Project Notes

Found the architectural issues with agent/session/project model configuration:

## KEY FINDINGS:

### 1. ROGUE createSession METHOD (Lines 115-141 in agent.ts)
The Agent class has a static `createSession` method that bypasses the proper Project -> Session -> Agent hierarchy. This method:
- Creates providers directly without considering project/session configs
- Hard-codes model selection logic
- Bypasses proper session creation flow
- Creates infrastructure that should be managed by Session class

### 2. HARDCODED MODEL DEFAULTS
Multiple locations with hardcoded `claude-3-haiku-20240307`:
- `session.ts` line 62: Session.create default parameter
- `session.ts` line 577: getDefaultModel method
- Throughout test files

### 3. MODEL CONFIGURATION FLOW INCONSISTENCIES
**Agent metadata vs provider instances:**
- Agent.model getter (line 385-387) gets from thread metadata
- Agent provider instance uses model from provider config
- These can diverge when restoration doesn't match creation

**Session creation vs restoration:**
- Session.create: Uses hardcoded defaults
- Session.getById: Tries to get from session config, but has fallback logic that may not work consistently
- Line 161-167: Falls back to provider default if no model in session config

### 4. ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS
- Agent shouldn't create sessions (createSession method)
- Session should get model config from Project hierarchy
- Provider instances should be created with model from effective configuration

### 5. PROVIDER DEFAULT MODEL MISMATCH
AnthropicProvider:
- defaultModel property: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514' (line 68)
- getAvailableModels: claude-sonnet-4 is marked as isDefault: true
But Session.getDefaultModel returns 'claude-3-haiku-20240307' for anthropic provider

This explains the bug: metadata shows correct model but provider calls use different model due to inconsistent configuration flow.
