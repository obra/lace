## Project Notes

Data Preservation for Compaction Rearchitecture:

CURRENT STATE:
- ThreadPersistence stores both canonical and shadow threads
- Canonical ID mappings in database
- Thread events stored per thread ID
- Some threads may have multiple shadow versions

RISKS:
- Losing shadow thread data during migration
- Breaking canonical ID â†’ shadow ID mappings
- Losing compaction history/metadata
- Breaking existing references in web UI, agents, etc.

MIGRATION NEEDS:
- Export all thread data before changes
- Preserve canonical ID relationships  
- Merge shadow thread events back to canonical threads
- Maintain event chronological order
- Test data integrity after migration
