## Project Notes

Thread Compaction Architecture Issues:

BROKEN FLOW:
1. Agent created with threadId "abc123" 
2. ThreadManager.createCompactedVersion() creates shadow thread "abc123_v1"
3. ThreadManager switches current thread to shadow thread
4. Agent._getActiveThreadId() still returns "abc123" 
5. Agent.sendMessage() tries to add events to "abc123" but ThreadManager expects "abc123_v1"
6. Cache inconsistency causes "Thread not found" errors

ROOT CAUSE: Agent and ThreadManager have different concepts of "active thread" after compaction

SHARED CACHE IMPACT: The move from instance-level to shared cache in commit 34ffad39 made this latent bug visible because now cache misses are more apparent across ThreadManager instances.

DESIGN FLAW: The canonical ID system assumes transparent operation but Agent operations break because it doesn't know about shadow threads.
