## Project Notes

Jesse is dealing with thread isolation failure where thread "lace_20250721_t3tbeg.2" is getting events from other threads mixed in. Initially suspected getDelegateThreadsFor method but analysis shows:

- getDelegateThreadsFor method is correctly implemented with proper SQL pattern matching
- loadEvents method correctly filters by exact thread_id match
- The bug is likely in how agent determines its active thread ID or in event storage

Need to add debug logging to agent.ts to trace:
1. What thread ID the agent thinks it's using
2. What events it's actually loading
3. Whether event thread_id values are correct in database

The threading architecture uses delegate threads with dot notation (parent.child) which should work correctly with LIKE pattern matching.
