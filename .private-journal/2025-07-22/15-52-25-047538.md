## Project Notes

Found the root cause! The logger configuration issue is clear now:

**Instrumentation hook logger config**: level: 'debug', logFile: undefined, useStderr: true
**API route logger config**: level: 'info', logFile: undefined, useStderr: false

The API route is seeing a completely different logger configuration than what the instrumentation hook set up. This proves that the logger instances are separate or the configuration isn't being shared properly.

The instrumentation hook successfully configured the logger with debug level and stderr output, but when the API route imports the logger, it gets the default configuration (info level, no stderr).

This suggests either:
1. Separate logger instances (shouldn't happen with singleton pattern)
2. Module loading order issue where API route imports logger before instrumentation runs
3. Next.js module isolation or compilation differences

Also noticed there's an unrelated Anthropic API error about missing tool_result blocks, but that's separate from the logging issue.

The fix likely needs to ensure the logger configuration happens before any route modules are loaded, or find a way to reconfigure the logger when routes are loaded.
