## Project Notes

Looking at the files I've read, I can see the implementation is complete:

1. `instrumentation.ts` - Has the register() hook that initializes logging in Node.js runtime only
2. Both key API routes have `export const runtime = 'nodejs';` added:
   - `/api/threads/[threadId]/message/route.ts` (line 14) - handles actual message sending to agents
   - `/api/sessions/[sessionId]/agents/route.ts` (line 11) - handles agent creation 
3. The history route doesn't have the runtime export, but that's likely okay since it doesn't trigger provider calls

The solution follows Next.js 15 best practices and addresses the multi-runtime environment issue. The user's concern was that they could see instrumentation logging but not provider debug logs when sending messages to Anthropic. By forcing Node.js runtime on the message route, provider calls should now have full logging capabilities.

The implementation looks complete and ready for testing. Since this was the last task I was working on from the conversation summary, I should now test it to verify the logging works as expected.
