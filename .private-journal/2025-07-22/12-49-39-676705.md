## Project Notes

Investigation into prompt duplication in thread lace_20250721_t3tbeg.1 reveals several key architectural patterns:

1. **Event Flow Architecture**: Events flow from Agent -> ThreadManager -> Database -> API -> UI, with conversion points at each stage

2. **Agent Auto-Start Behavior**: Agents have "auto-start when needed" behavior that could trigger multiple initialization sequences if not properly guarded

3. **Session vs Agent vs Thread Relationship**: 
   - Sessions have ID like "lace_20250721_t3tbeg" 
   - Agents have threadId like "lace_20250721_t3tbeg.1"
   - Multiple agents can exist per session
   - Each agent initialization adds SYSTEM_PROMPT events

4. **Event Storage vs Processing Split**: Events are stored in database but processed separately for UI display. Missing event type handlers can cause display issues.

5. **Potential Duplication Sources**:
   - Multiple agent spawns in same session  
   - Agent restarts/auto-starts
   - Missing deduplication logic
   - Event processing retries
   - Session reconstruction from database adding duplicate setup events

The specific thread ID pattern suggests this is agent #1 in the session, so investigating why agent initialization might be happening multiple times is key.
