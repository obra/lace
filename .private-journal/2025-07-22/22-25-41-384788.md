## Project Notes

Key finding: Session.getWorkingDirectory() method (lines 377-391) already implements the correct logic:
1. Check session configuration for workingDirectory
2. Fall back to project working directory 
3. Fall back to process.cwd()

But ProjectVariableProvider.getVariables() hardcodes process.cwd() on line 130. Need to pass session working directory to the variable provider somehow.
