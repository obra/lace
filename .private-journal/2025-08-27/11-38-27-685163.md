## Project Notes

Jesse confirmed the executable is working but the provider catalogs aren't loading when copied to another host. This means:

1. The React Router assets are now working (no more 404s on /assets/* routes)
2. The JSON provider catalogs are embedded via --loader .json:file but aren't being found by the resource resolver

The issue is that the resource resolver is still trying to use file system paths, but those don't exist on the target system. The bundled JSON files (like anthropic-p21h2h4h.json) are embedded in the executable but the resource resolver doesn't know how to access them.

I need to:
1. Update the resource resolver to detect bundled mode
2. Make it use the bundled asset paths instead of file system paths
3. The load context I'm passing has the bundled asset paths - the resource resolver needs to use those
