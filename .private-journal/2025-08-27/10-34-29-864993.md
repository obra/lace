## Project Notes

Current state analysis:

CURRENT APPROACH (complex):
1. Build React Router app to packages/web/build/
2. Create ZIP of build/ + src/ + node_modules + server.ts 
3. Bun bundle with ZIP as binary data import
4. At startup: extract ZIP to temp dir, chdir to extracted web/, run server.ts

PROPOSED APPROACH (cleaner):
1. Build React Router app to packages/web/build/
2. Generate VFS from build/client/ directory (like existing react-router-client-vfs.ts)
3. Create server that serves from VFS instead of express.static()
4. Bun compile server + VFS into single executable
5. No temp dir extraction needed!

Key insight: Jesse already has VFS generation working in react-router-client-vfs.ts. The current server-custom.ts uses express.static() for build/client/ - we need to replace that with VFS serving.

Challenge: The current resource-resolver.ts handles provider catalogs and prompts, but static web assets are different. We need VFS for web assets, but keep the existing resource resolution for backend data.

Architecture:
- VFS for React Router build/client/ assets (CSS, JS, HTML)
- Keep existing resource resolution for provider catalogs in packages/core/src/providers/catalog/data/
- Single executable with no temp extraction
