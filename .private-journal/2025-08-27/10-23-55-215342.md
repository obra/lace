## Project Notes

Jesse wants to migrate from the crazy NextJS zip extraction approach to using Bun's build --compile. Key insight: the make-vfs approach from the articles looks promising - it converts static assets to a JavaScript module with base64 encoding, then serves them via Express middleware.

Current architecture: React Router 7 server with static asset serving in production. We already have the resource resolver pattern working for finding provider catalogs and prompts.

The make-vfs approach would replace our static asset serving with a virtual file system. Instead of `express.static('build/client')`, we'd have middleware that serves from the VFS bundle.

Need to analyze the current NextJS approach to understand what we're replacing and ensure we maintain the same deployment simplicity.
