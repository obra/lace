## Project Notes

Lace React Router 7 migration mostly successful, but hit a production bundle issue:

WORKING:
- Static asset serving (CSS, JS files) ✓
- API routes (like /api/health) ✓  
- Basic server startup ✓
- Development mode ✓

ISSUE: 
- Production mode crashes when actually loading routes due to ProviderCatalogManager trying to resolve builtin provider catalogs using relative paths that don't work from the bundled location
- Error: "module file:///.../build/server/assets/server-build-DmJxlmXg.js is not in src/ or packages/core/src/ directory"

This suggests the Lace core code has hardcoded assumptions about file structure that break when bundled. Need to either:
1. Fix the path resolution in core
2. Ensure required data files are copied to build output  
3. Make paths environment-aware
