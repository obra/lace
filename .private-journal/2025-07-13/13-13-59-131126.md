## Project Notes

Key architectural insight: The CLI is the launcher/orchestrator, not just a terminal interface. When starting with `--ui web`, the web interface should connect to the SAME Agent thread that the CLI creates. This means:

1. CLI creates the main Agent and thread (like `lace_20250713_g9aapm`)
2. Web interface connects to that SAME thread
3. Status API should return the current active thread from the CLI Agent
4. All conversations should use that same thread ID

The issue is that the web interface is creating NEW threads instead of using the existing one from the CLI.
