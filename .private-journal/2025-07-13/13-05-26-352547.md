## Project Notes

Critical issue: Thread ID mismatch between terminal output and web UI. The Agent creates thread `lace_20250713_85nwoc` but the web UI might be showing something different. Need to test:
1. Agent status API returns correct thread ID
2. Web UI displays same thread ID as Agent creates
3. Subsequent messages use same thread ID
4. Tools execute with correct thread context

The E2E test I was working on should catch this but needs to be automated and run with real API key.
