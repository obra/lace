## Lace Terminology Patterns

Looking at the codebase, the terminology follows some clear patterns:

1. **Event-prefixed terms**: Event sourcing is central, so we have EventType, ThreadEvent, event_added, etc.

2. **Thread-prefixed terms**: Thread is the core conversation unit - ThreadManager, ThreadProcessor, ThreadId, threadId everywhere.

3. **Provider abstraction terms**: Provider, ProviderMessage, ProviderToolCall - generic interfaces that each AI provider implements.

4. **Timeline terms**: Timeline, TimelineItem, TimelineProcessor - the UI layer's view of conversations.

5. **Tool-related terms**: Tool, ToolCall, ToolResult, ToolExecutor, ToolContext - comprehensive tool system.

6. **Streaming/real-time terms**: streaming, ephemeral, incremental - for real-time UI updates.

7. **Agent terms**: Agent, AgentState, AgentEvents - the core conversation engine.

The codebase is very consistent with terminology. Files start with ABOUTME comments that help understand purpose. The type system is well-defined with branded types (ThreadId, AssigneeId, NewAgentSpec).

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is mentioned as a standard they're aligning with for tool definitions.
