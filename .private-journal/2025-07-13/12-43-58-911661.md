## Project Notes

The agent status API at /api/agent/status is returning a 500 error. This endpoint is supposed to get the latest thread ID from the Agent system when the web interface loads. The error is likely in the getAgentFromRequest() function or the agent.getLatestThreadId() method. Need to check if the Agent has the getLatestThreadId method implemented and if the agent context is working properly.
