## Project Notes

The streaming API has multiple code paths that can call controller.close():
1. Line 223: conversation_complete event handler
2. Line 237: error event handler  
3. Line 255: try/catch error handling
4. Line 260: cancel() method (though this one is now empty)

This creates potential for race conditions where multiple handlers try to close the same controller. We need to add a guard to prevent double-closing.
