## Project Notes

Fixed streaming UI issue in web interface. The problem was in useConversationStream.ts where startStream wasn't passing messageId to sendMessage, breaking the callback chain that updates the UI with streaming tokens.

Previous work completed:
- Fixed 500 error in streaming API by using globalThis for agent sharing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for streaming endpoints
- Now fixed the UI streaming display issue

The web chat interface should now work end-to-end with real-time streaming responses. Token updates will appear immediately in the UI as the agent responds, rather than only showing in server logs.

Key files modified:
- src/interfaces/web/hooks/useConversationStream.ts (fixed messageId parameter)
- src/interfaces/web/lib/agent-context.ts (fixed agent sharing)

Both the 500 error and streaming UI issues are now resolved.
