## Project Notes

The streaming API is currently closing the controller on:
1. conversation_complete - This seems wrong for SSE
2. error events - This makes sense for unrecoverable errors  
3. try/catch errors - This makes sense for setup errors

For a chat interface, the stream should stay open and only close when:
- The client disconnects (cancel method)
- There's an unrecoverable error
- The server explicitly terminates the session

The "conversation_complete" event should just signal that the current response is done, not close the entire stream.
