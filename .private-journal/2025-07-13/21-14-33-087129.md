## Project Notes

Jesse wants to create a new clean Next.js backend from scratch to prove out the shared SSE stream architecture. This is a good idea because:

1. Current backend has accumulated complexity 
2. Shared stream is better for multi-agentic future
3. Clean slate lets us design it right from start
4. Simple frontend reduces variables while testing
5. Can validate architecture before porting back

Should probably:
- Create new clean Next.js project in subdirectory
- Implement shared SSE stream from scratch  
- Simple chat UI just to test streaming
- Focus on proving the architecture works
- Then port learnings back to main codebase
