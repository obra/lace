## Project Notes

The caching implementation I completed includes:
- Session._sessionData caching with automatic database query elimination
- Project._projectData caching with same pattern
- Registry optimization for Session.getSession()
- Cache consistency maintenance through update methods

But now there's a critical bug: "a.timestamp.getTime is not a function" from the session history API. This suggests my caching changes broke Date object handling somewhere in the data flow.

Need to investigate:
1. How SessionData/ProjectData Date fields are being loaded from database
2. Whether my caching is preserving Date object types correctly
3. How events are being processed through the cached Agent/Session layer

The error is coming from the history endpoint which loads events through coordinatorAgent.getMainAndDelegateEvents() and serializes them with superjson.
