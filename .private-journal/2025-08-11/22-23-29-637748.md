## Project Notes

Successfully completed the comprehensive database caching implementation from docs/plans/2025-08-11/caching.md. All original goals achieved:

✅ **Session Caching:**
- Added _sessionData internal caching 
- Registry optimization in Session.getSession()
- Cache-consistent Session.updateSession() 
- refreshFromDatabase() for external updates

✅ **Project Caching:**
- Added _projectData internal caching
- Cache-consistent updateInfo() method
- refreshFromDatabase() for external updates

✅ **Cache Invalidation:**
- Session.updateSession() now updates cached instances in registry
- Fixed session-service test failures caused by registry returning stale data
- Proper separation of registry optimization vs direct database queries

✅ **Testing:**
- All 788 tests pass
- Added comprehensive caching tests with real database operations (no mocks)
- Verified cache behavior with database query counting

✅ **Documentation:**
- Created docs/architecture/caching.md with implementation guidelines
- Added JSDoc comments to key methods

The timestamp serialization error I initially thought was related to caching turned out to be unrelated - it was resolved by fixing other test issues.
