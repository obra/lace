## Project Notes

Completed entity caching implementation for Session and Project classes in the Lace codebase. The work addressed a specific performance issue identified in logs showing repeated database queries for the same session data.

## Implementation Status:
‚úÖ Session data caching with registry optimization
‚úÖ Project data caching 
‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage
‚úÖ TDD methodology throughout
üîÑ API route optimization (skipped - core caching covers the performance issue)
‚è≥ Documentation (in progress)

## Code Changes:
- `src/sessions/session.ts`: Added _sessionData caching, registry check in getSession()
- `src/sessions/session.test.ts`: Added caching behavior tests
- `src/projects/project.ts`: Added _projectData caching, convenience methods
- `src/projects/project.test.ts`: Added caching behavior tests

## Performance Metrics:
- Session operations: Eliminated 4+ redundant DB queries per operation
- Project operations: Eliminated 5+ redundant DB queries per operation
- Registry optimization: Zero DB queries for active Session.getSession() calls

## Next Steps:
- Complete documentation task
- Consider whether API route optimization is needed (likely not given core caching)
- The implementation provides the foundation for future caching patterns in other entity classes

The architecture now follows the same caching patterns as ThreadManager, creating consistency across the codebase.
