## Project Notes

Need to completely remove:
- TimelineContent sliding window logic
- WindowManagement interface and callbacks
- All the sliding-window-logic.ts functions
- Mock viewport in tests
- Progressive loading and boundary detection
- Item position caching and render start/end indices

Go back to simple approach:
- Render all timeline items directly
- Basic up/down arrow navigation
- Simple g/G to jump to first/last items
- No windowing, no virtualization, no complex state management
