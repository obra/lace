## Project Notes

The timeline windowing issue is in TimelineContent.tsx lines 55-70. The windowing logic always limits to `viewportLines + 5` items, even during session resumption with --continue mode. This means:

1. StreamingTimelineProcessor correctly loads ALL historical events on resume
2. But TimelineContent still only renders the most recent items due to windowing
3. Users expect to see full conversation history when using --continue mode
4. The windowing should be conditional - full history on resume, windowed for real-time

Key files:
- `/src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/TimelineContent.tsx` - windowing logic
- `/src/interfaces/streaming-timeline-processor.ts` - event loading  
- `/src/interfaces/terminal/terminal-interface.tsx` - session initialization
- `/src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/hooks/useTimelineViewport.ts` - viewport positioning

The fix would need to pass session resumption state to TimelineContent to disable windowing during --continue mode.
