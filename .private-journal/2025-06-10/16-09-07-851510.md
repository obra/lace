## Project Notes

Continuing PROMPT 4 execution from bad-tests.md. Jesse said "lfg" so I should proceed with rewriting the file completion tests.

Current status:
- PROMPT 1: âœ… COMPLETED (App tests + React key fix)  
- PROMPT 2: âœ… RESOLVED (snapshot tests were actually implemented)
- PROMPT 3: âœ… COMPLETED (deleted flaky performance tests)
- PROMPT 4: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (rewrite file completion tests)

The file completion tests need to be rewritten to focus on completion behavior instead of filesystem mocking. Both files extensively mock filesystem operations when they should be testing completion logic with mock data.

Plan for PROMPT 4:
1. Rewrite FileCompletionProvider.test.js to use mock completion data
2. Rewrite FilesAndDirectoriesCompletionProvider.test.ts to focus on behavior
3. Remove all filesystem mocking and test completion results instead
4. Update bad-tests.md to mark PROMPT 4 as completed
