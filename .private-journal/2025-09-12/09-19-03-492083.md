## Project Notes

Jesse suggests using requiredParameters filter instead of requireToolSupport - much more flexible! This would allow filtering for any combination of capabilities like:
- ["tools"] for tool support
- ["tools", "response_format"] for structured output support
- ["reasoning", "include_reasoning"] for reasoning models
- ["temperature", "top_p"] for models with temperature control

This is a better abstraction that doesn't hardcode specific features.
