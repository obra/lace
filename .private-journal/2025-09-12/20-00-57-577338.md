## Project Notes

Jesse is showing me the provider instance cards and asking about exposing model enable/disable options for ALL provider types, not just OpenRouter. This is actually a great idea - users might want to disable specific models from any provider, not just routers.

Looking at the UI, I can see 4 provider instances:
- Anthropic (Default) - anthropic 
- OpenAI (Default) - openai
- Groq - groq  
- OpenRouter - openrouter

Currently our system only handles dynamic catalogs for OpenRouter, but the model filtering logic could work for any provider that has a catalog with multiple models.

The lift would be:
1. Extend the ProviderInstanceCard to show model management for ANY provider with multiple models
2. Use the static catalog data for non-OpenRouter providers
3. Apply the same filtering logic
4. Save model config in provider-instances.json for all provider types

This is actually not a huge lift since we already have:
- ModelFilterService that works on any model array
- ModelConfig schema that's provider-agnostic
- UI components that are generic

The main changes would be:
1. Update ProviderInstanceCard to check if provider has multiple models (not just openrouter)
2. Fetch catalog data for all providers
3. Show the model management UI for any multi-model provider

This would be much more valuable than just OpenRouter-specific filtering.
