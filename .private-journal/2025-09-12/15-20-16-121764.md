**Nice-to-Have Improvements:**
- Accessibility enhancements (ARIA attributes)
- IME composition handling for international users
- Better test isolation and unused import cleanup

**Reviewer Quality:**
- Found real bugs (defaultPersonaName ignored)
- Understands codebase architecture well
- Provides specific, actionable fixes
- Good balance of critical vs nice-to-have

This reviewer demonstrates strong technical skills and attention to detail.
