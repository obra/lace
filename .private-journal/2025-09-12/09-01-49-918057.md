## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to create a gold-standard test for persona system prompt behavior rather than taking shortcuts. 

The test should verify that:
1. Agents created with different personas get different system prompts
2. The persona parameter flows through correctly
3. The system prompts are actually different (not just the fallback)

Current issues:
- Calling initialize() on AgentInfo instead of Agent instances
- Accessing internal implementation details incorrectly
- Not properly testing the actual intended behavior

Need to figure out the proper way to get Agent instances and test their system prompt generation correctly.
