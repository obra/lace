## Project Notes

Jesse is hitting several issues with the universal model management system:

1. HTTP 500: "registry.getInstanceManager is not a function" - This suggests the ProviderRegistry singleton doesn't have the expected method, or there's an import/export issue.

2. HTTP 400: "Invalid model configuration" - The ModelConfig schema validation is failing. Need to check what data is being sent vs what the schema expects.

3. UI issue: When models are unchecked, they disappear completely instead of staying visible but showing as disabled. This is wrong UX - disabled models should remain visible but grayed out.

4. Filter functionality not working - the price, context, and feature filters aren't actually filtering the display.

These are integration issues that need debugging:
- Check the API endpoint implementation 
- Check the schema validation
- Fix the UI filtering logic
- Fix the model visibility logic
