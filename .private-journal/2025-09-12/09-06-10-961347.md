## Project Notes

Design confirmed for dynamic catalog:
- Single file per instance: LACE_DIR/catalogs/openrouter-{instanceId}.json
- Include _meta object with fetchedAt, version, modelCount, source
- No timestamps in filename - cleaner file management
- Can easily check staleness and display in UI

Next sections to cover:
1. Model filtering/configuration storage
2. UI integration for model management
3. API integration details
4. Implementation plan
