## Project Notes

Jesse wants to extend the provider catalog system to support dynamic model fetching from OpenRouter's API. The key requirements are:

1. Cache model catalogs daily in LACE_DIR, refresh on startup and manually
2. Store model enable/disable config in provider-instances.json (per-instance)
3. Sensible defaults: tool-capable models enabled by default, new models auto-enabled
4. Group models by provider with provider-level toggle
5. Show pricing and model stats in the UI
6. Model config UI inline on provider instance card (not collapsible)

The challenge is OpenRouter has 500+ models (177 with tool support) that change daily. Static JSON won't work - need dynamic fetching from their API.

Architecture thoughts:
- Extend ProviderInstance type to include modelFilters or enabledModels config
- Create a DynamicCatalogProvider that fetches from API and caches locally
- Cache in LACE_DIR/catalogs/openrouter-{timestamp}.json
- Merge cached data with instance-specific enable/disable settings
- ModelSelector reads from this merged/filtered view
