## Project Notes

Directory browser implementation is complete and integrated. The component provides:

- Real-time directory browsing with API integration
- Security restrictions to home directory only  
- Autocomplete with 3+ character trigger
- Navigation with breadcrumbs and parent/home buttons
- Double-click to browse into directories
- Error handling for API failures and invalid paths
- Complete replacement of manual text inputs in ProjectSelectorPanel
- Storybook documentation with multiple variants
- 193 passing tests including real filesystem operations

Architecture decisions:
- Used Zod for API validation schemas
- Real filesystem operations instead of mocking for better integration confidence
- Browser/Node compatibility with getHomedir() helper
- Progressive enhancement - works as text input even if API fails
- Security-first with path traversal protection

Files created/modified:
- types/filesystem.ts - TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas
- app/api/filesystem/list/route.ts - Secure API endpoint  
- components/ui/DirectoryField.tsx - Main component with dropdown browser
- components/config/ProjectSelectorPanel.tsx - Integration with project creation
- Comprehensive test coverage and Storybook documentation

The component is production-ready and provides a much better UX than manual path entry.
