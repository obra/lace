## Project Notes

Lace currently uses Vitest but no terminal-specific testing. The app is built with Ink/React so ink-testing-library would be the natural choice. For true e2e testing that spawns the actual CLI process, would need node-pty or similar. Jesse wants to inject keyboard events and observe screen output - this suggests needing both approaches: unit tests with ink-testing-library and e2e tests with pty.
