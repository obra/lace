## Project Notes

Jesse wants to simplify the UI behavior - instead of prompting the user whether to queue when agent is busy, it should just queue by default. This is much cleaner and simpler than the spec suggested.

So the new behavior should be:
- When agent is idle: process message immediately
- When agent is busy: queue message automatically, show feedback that it was queued

This is much better UX - no interruption, just smooth queueing. I should update the handleSubmit function to use agent.sendMessage with { queue: true } when the agent is busy.
