## Project Notes

Reading the buffered notifications spec - this is a well-structured plan for adding message queueing to agents. The spec breaks down into clear phases:

1. Add message queue types and Agent queue functionality
2. Integrate queue processing with state transitions 
3. Add system notification formatting
4. UI integration with React/Ink
5. Event emissions
6. Testing and polish

Key technical insights:
- Agent has state machine: idle → thinking → streaming → tool_execution → idle
- Queue only when agent is not idle, process when returning to idle
- Priority support with high-priority messages going to front
- React/Ink UI considerations (terminal rendering, no DOM)
- Event-driven architecture requires proper event emissions

The plan is thorough and follows the codebase patterns I can see from the CLAUDE.md context. Jesse's approach here is very systematic and follows good engineering practices.
