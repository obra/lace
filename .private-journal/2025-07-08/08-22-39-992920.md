## Project Notes

Created src/__tests__/e2e-pty-terminal.test.ts with three passing tests: full workflow, /help command, and /exit command. Tests use node-pty to spawn actual CLI process with lmstudio provider, inject keyboard events via terminal.write(), and capture full terminal output. Tests verify slash commands work and agent responds to queries. This gives Lace proper e2e testing capability for terminal interactions.
