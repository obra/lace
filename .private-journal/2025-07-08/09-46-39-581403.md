## Project Notes

Phase 3 completed cleanly! NotificationFormatter is simple and focused. 

Phase 4 is UI integration - this is where things get more complex because we're dealing with React/Ink terminal interface. The spec calls for:

1. QueueIndicator component to show queue status
2. Update input handling to offer queueing when agent is busy

Key considerations for Phase 4:
- Ink uses React but renders to terminal (Box/Text components, no DOM)
- Need to understand existing terminal interface structure
- Should be simple additions, not major rewrites
- Test React components using JSDoc environment

Looking at the spec, this should be straightforward UI work - add a queue indicator and modify input handling. Let me start with failing tests for the QueueIndicator component.
