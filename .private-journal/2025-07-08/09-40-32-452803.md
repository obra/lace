## Project Notes

Phase 2 completed successfully! The message queue integration is working perfectly with:
- Auto-processing on state transitions to idle
- sendMessage() queue option support
- Error handling and event emissions
- All 157 tests passing

Next up is Phase 3: System Notifications. According to the spec, this involves creating notification formatters for task assignments and completions. This is a simple, focused phase that should be quick to implement.

Key implementation points for Phase 3:
- Create NotificationFormatter class in src/agents/notifications.ts
- Static methods for formatTaskAssignment and formatTaskCompletion
- Simple string formatting with proper escaping
- Comprehensive test coverage

The design is clean and follows YAGNI - just the specific notification types mentioned in the spec.
