## Project Notes

TypeScript compilation is failing on our new queue tests due to:

1. **Usage token field names**: We're using `inputTokens`/`outputTokens` but the type expects `promptTokens`/`completionTokens`/`totalTokens`
2. **Missing required Agent constructor parameters**: Missing `threadId` and `tools` in some test setups  
3. **Mock access issues**: Using `.mock` on functions that aren't properly mocked
4. **Type casting issues**: Some function calls expecting specific types

These are test implementation issues, not problems with the core queue functionality (which all tests prove is working correctly). Need to fix the TypeScript issues to get the build passing.
