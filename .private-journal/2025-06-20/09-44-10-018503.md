## Project Notes

Completed Phase 1+ of terminal messages redesign with thinking block architecture fix. Major accomplishment was moving thinking block parsing from UI layer to Agent layer using streaming SAX parser.

Key insight: The ordering issue was because thinking blocks were being extracted AFTER all streaming was complete, but they needed to be captured during streaming to maintain proper chronological order with tool calls.

Architecture now properly separates concerns:
- Agent: Handles thinking block parsing and emits proper events
- ThreadManager: Stores THINKING events with correct timestamps
- UI: Just displays what's in ThreadEvents chronologically

Next phases could include subagent conversation hierarchies and more specialized tool displays.
