## Project Notes

Debugging delegation successfully identified the real issue. The problem isn't:
- Thread ID generation ✅ 
- Event storage ✅
- UI synchronization ✅  
- ThreadManager state switching (probably not the main issue)

The REAL problem is subagent conversation termination logic. Subagents are getting stuck in infinite tool execution loops and never emit 'conversation_complete'.

Next steps should focus on:
1. Subagent conversation termination conditions
2. Tool execution limits/timeouts in subagents  
3. Better completion detection in Agent class
4. Investigation of why conversation_complete never fires

The debug logging infrastructure is now in place to trace this more effectively. The ThreadManager debug shows setCurrentThread calls, the UI sync shows event flow, and delegate tool shows cleanup.
