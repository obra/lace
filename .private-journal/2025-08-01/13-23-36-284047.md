## Project Notes

Looking at the API routes that are already updated:

1. `/app/api/threads/[threadId]/message/route.ts` - Already properly uses EventStreamManager.broadcast() with StreamEvent format
2. `/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/agents/route.ts` - Already properly uses EventStreamManager.broadcast() with StreamEvent format

Both of these are correctly structured and use the new clean API. The current todo item is "Update production callers to use proper StreamEvent format" which seems to be mostly done for these two files.

However, I need to check what other production callers exist. The session-service.ts file is likely the main one with multiple broadcast calls that need updating based on the conversation summary mentioning "7 occurrences of `sseManager.broadcast(sessionId, event)`".

Let me continue with the session-service.ts file since that's the next logical step and was mentioned specifically in the conversation summary.
