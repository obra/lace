## Project Notes

Completed ToolResult type fixes for compaction strategy files:

Files fixed:
- /Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/lace/.worktrees/f-types/src/threads/compaction/trim-tool-results-strategy.test.ts - Fixed ContentBlock types with proper literal types and ToolResult interface
- /Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/lace/.worktrees/f-types/src/threads/compaction/trim-tool-results-strategy.ts - Fixed implementation to use discriminated union type narrowing

Key technical details:
- ContentBlock interface requires type literals: 'text' | 'image' | 'resource' 
- Image blocks use `uri` property, not `url`
- ToolResult has metadata field for additional properties
- Use `event.type === 'TOOL_RESULT'` for type narrowing before accessing event.data

All tests passing, TypeScript errors in these files resolved. Remaining errors are in other files not related to ToolResult types.
