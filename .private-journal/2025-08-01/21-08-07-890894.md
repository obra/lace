## Project Notes

Jesse asked for analysis of TypeScript naming consistency and confusing patterns. Found several critical issues:

**Type Shadowing:**
- `EventType` defined differently in `/src/events/types.ts` vs `/src/threads/types.ts`
- Multiple `*EventData` interfaces with similar but slightly different structures

**Inconsistent Patterns:**
- Event data structures duplicated across src/events/, packages/web/types/api.ts, packages/web/types/events.ts
- Mix of "Data" vs "Event" vs "Info" suffixes without clear distinction
- Some interfaces use timestamp: Date, others use timestamp: string

**Historical/Implementation Names:**
- `NewAgentSpec` type references "New" (temporal context)
- Various "Manager" classes throughout

Need to provide comprehensive analysis covering all the naming issues I found.
