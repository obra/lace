## Project Notes

Looking at the e2e test file, I can see it's still referencing the old SSEManager and using the old broadcast signature `sseManager.broadcast(sessionId, event)`. This needs to be updated to use EventStreamManager and the new StreamEvent format.

The test is mocking the old SSEManager interface which no longer exists in the real codebase. I need to:

1. Update the imports to use EventStreamManager
2. Update the mock to match the new EventStreamManager API 
3. Update all the test calls to use the new broadcast format
4. Update the test expectations to match the new StreamEvent format

This is part of the "stream-test-4" todo item: "Fix e2e tests that reference old streaming infrastructure"
