## Project Notes

This plan addresses the current limitation where only one instance per provider type is possible due to environment variable based configuration. The new system will allow multiple configured instances (e.g., "OpenAI Production", "OpenAI Dev", "Local Ollama") with different endpoints, timeouts, and credentials.

The catalog system using Catwalk data is smart - provides rich metadata about costs, capabilities, context windows that users need for informed decisions. User extensions allow for local/experimental providers.

The plan properly integrates with existing architecture - providers are already abstracted, so this mainly changes how they're configured and instantiated rather than requiring major refactoring.

The migration strategy ensures existing users don't lose their current setup when upgrading.
