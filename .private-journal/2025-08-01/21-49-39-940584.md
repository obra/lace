## Project Notes

Looking at the type-repair.md document, this is a MUCH more comprehensive plan than my focused 3-phase approach. Key differences:

MY PLAN (focused):
- Phase 1: Fix Event Stream Manager TypeScript violations  
- Phase 2: Eliminate Session/Agent duplication
- Phase 3: Fix test failures

TYPE-REPAIR.MD PLAN (comprehensive):
- Phase 1: EventType name collision (rename to ThreadEventType/StreamEventCategory)
- Phase 2: Web package consolidation (merge events.ts/api.ts)
- Phase 3: Tool approval type unification 
- Phase 4: Event system architecture unification
- Phase 5: Naming convention standardization
- Phase 6: Timestamp standardization  
- Phase 7: Validation schema centralization
- Phase 8: Long-term architecture

The type-repair.md plan is more ambitious and addresses the original comprehensive reorganization goals. However, given that:
1. Tests are currently failing (1 test failure)
2. Event stream manager has 35+ TypeScript violations
3. Current state is WORSE than before

I believe my focused approach might be more practical for immediate needs, but the type-repair.md plan is the proper long-term solution Jesse likely wants to see implemented.

The type-repair.md plan also includes better:
- Rollback strategies with legacy exports
- Risk assessment 
- Success metrics
- Detailed implementation guidelines

My plan was emergency triage, theirs is proper architecture.
