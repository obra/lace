## Project Notes

Compaction E2E Test Status:

Successfully implemented:
- SSE streaming format for MSW that doesn't crash
- Proper event structure with event: and data: fields  
- Token counting endpoint mock
- Basic message flow works

Still failing:
- Usage data not being captured (hasUsage: false in test output)
- Auto-compaction not triggering (no COMPACTION_START events)
- Manual /compact command timing out

The core issue is that while streaming works, the Anthropic SDK isn't properly accumulating the usage data from our mocked responses. The finalMessage() method depends on internal state that isn't being populated correctly.

The simple integration test (compaction-simple.test.ts) works fine because it uses a mock provider, not the real Anthropic SDK with MSW interception.
