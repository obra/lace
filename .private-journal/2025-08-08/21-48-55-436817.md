## Project Notes

Compaction E2E test debugging findings:
- Token budget IS being initialized (200k from model, then updated to 12k for testing)
- Usage IS being tracked and accumulated
- But something resets the TokenBudgetManager between messages 3 and 4
- The test structure seems correct, MSW is working, events are flowing
- Issue is in the runtime behavior, not the test setup
