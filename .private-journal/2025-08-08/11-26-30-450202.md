## Project Notes

The Lace codebase has a sophisticated event-sourcing architecture where:
- All conversation state is built from immutable events
- Tool calls generate TOOL_CALL events, and must have corresponding TOOL_RESULT events
- The Agent maintains batch tracking (_pendingToolCount, _hasRejectionsInBatch)
- Tool execution happens through a chain: Agent -> ToolExecutor -> Tool
- Each tool extends a base Tool class with executeValidated() method

The abort mechanism currently only works for LLM streaming, not tool execution. The _abortController is used for provider API calls but not passed to tool execution.
