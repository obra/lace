## Project Notes

Current status on Task 10 (Session Creation Integration):
- I made an error by implementing provider instance selection at session level
- User corrected: "model and provider are PER AGENT, not per session"
- ModelSelectionForm component is correct for agent creation workflow
- Need to find agent creation components in SessionConfigPanel and integrate ModelSelectionForm there
- Session API currently has provider instance logic that should be refactored for agent-level selection
