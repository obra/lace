## Project Notes

Current E2E test coverage for provider instances:

COVERED:
- OpenAI provider instance resolution ✅
- Credential injection ✅ 
- Multiple endpoints ✅
- Fixed critical baseURL bug in OpenAI provider ✅

MISSING:
- Anthropic provider testing ❌
- LMStudio provider testing ❌ 
- Ollama provider testing ❌
- Agent creation API integration ❌
- UI workflow integration ❌
- Error scenarios (network failures, auth failures) ❌
- Streaming responses ❌
- Different auth methods ❌

Need to expand tests to cover all provider types and more error cases.
