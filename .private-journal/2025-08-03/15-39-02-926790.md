## Project Notes

Jesse is asking about implementation effort for the full Next.js App Router refactor vs the provider configuration work. Need to be realistic about scope and suggest a pragmatic approach.

The App Router refactor is a big lift - probably 2-3 weeks and would definitely interfere with provider work. But provider work can be done independently with current architecture.

Should suggest:
1. Do provider work first with existing architecture
2. App Router refactor as separate future milestone
3. Maybe identify specific pain points that actually need solving now vs nice-to-have architectural improvements
