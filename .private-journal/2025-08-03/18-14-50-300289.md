## Project Notes

Critical E2E testing gap identified and accepted by Jesse. Need to implement comprehensive E2E tests for provider instance system.

Key areas to test:
1. Provider instance resolution (instanceId → provider type → API call)
2. Credential usage (verify correct credentials sent to correct endpoints)
3. Multiple OpenAI-compatible endpoints working simultaneously
4. Error handling for invalid provider instances
5. Backward compatibility with legacy provider/model system

This is now a high-priority task that should be completed before considering the provider instance system "done".
