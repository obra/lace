## Project Notes

Jesse wants to apply the Next.js App Router + state management patterns to the entire Lace application. This means:

1. Root layout with global state providers
2. Real-time streams for agent state, tool execution, thread updates
3. Context providers for conversation state, session management
4. Server Components for static content, Client Components for interactive parts

Their event-sourcing architecture is actually perfect for this - ThreadProcessor already handles real-time updates and caching.

Need to design:
- App-level context providers
- SSE endpoints for real-time updates
- Layout hierarchy for different sections
- State persistence patterns

This is a significant refactor but builds well on their existing architecture.
