## Project Notes

Jesse is asking a critical question about test coverage for the provider instance system. Need to:

1. Search for existing E2E tests with provider mocking
2. Check if we have tests that verify provider instance resolution actually works
3. Look at the current test structure for provider integration
4. Assess whether we're actually testing the full flow from provider instance selection -> API resolution -> actual provider call

This is important because the provider instance system could appear to work in the UI but fail when actually making API calls if the resolution logic is broken.
