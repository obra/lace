## Project Notes

Just reviewed the E2E test file I created for testing stop functionality. It's comprehensive and covers three key scenarios:

1. Stop button clicking during slow responses
2. ESC key pressing to stop generation  
3. Streaming response interruption

The test uses SlowMockProvider with configurable delays and proper AbortSignal handling. The E2E test follows the established patterns from the existing web-ui.e2e.ts file.

However, there are a few potential issues I need to address:

1. The test tries to register providers in beforeEach, but this might not work properly with the Next.js app architecture - providers are usually registered at startup
2. The UI selector assumptions might not match the actual UI implementation
3. The test assumes certain UI elements exist that might not be implemented yet

I should run this test to see if it works, and if not, refine it based on the actual failures. The slow mock provider implementation looks solid with proper abort handling in both streaming and non-streaming modes.
