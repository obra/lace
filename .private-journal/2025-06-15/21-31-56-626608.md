## Project Notes

Phase 1 architectural refactor complete! Successfully extracted conversation processing from CLI into event-driven Agent class. Agent now emits typed events (thinking_start, tool_call_start, etc.) and manages state properly. CLI updated to use event handlers instead of direct calls.

Key files updated:
- src/agents/agent.ts: Enhanced from thin wrapper to full conversation processor with EventEmitter
- src/agents/__tests__/agent.test.ts: 579 lines of comprehensive unit tests
- src/agent.ts: Updated CLI to use new Agent class via event handlers
- src/__tests__/conversation-state.test.ts: Updated integration tests

CLI tested successfully with LMStudio - proper event flow and output display. Ready for Phase 2 (split CLI components) and Phase 3 (streaming support).
