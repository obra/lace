## Project Notes

Memory leak investigation resolved! Root cause was infinite async recursion in Agent tests due to MockProviders always returning tool calls.

Fixed by:
1. Making MockProviders return different responses (tools first, then stop)
2. Adding proper test cleanup: removeAllListeners(), toolRegistry.clear(), threadManager.clearEvents()
3. Adding clearEvents() method to ThreadManager

All 27 Agent tests now pass in 15ms. Phase 1 architectural refactor is complete:
- ✅ Event-driven Agent class working perfectly
- ✅ CLI integration successful 
- ✅ Memory management solid
- ✅ 579 lines of comprehensive tests passing

Ready for Phase 2: Split CLI components into args.ts and interface.ts
