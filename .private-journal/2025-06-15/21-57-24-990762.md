## Project Notes

Phase 2 completed successfully! Clean CLI architecture achieved:

New structure:
- src/cli.ts: Main orchestration entry point
- src/cli/args.ts: Command line argument parsing
- src/cli/interface.ts: Event-driven CLI interface class
- agents/agent.ts: Enhanced conversation processor

All functionality preserved:
✅ Single prompt mode working
✅ Interactive mode working  
✅ Help system working
✅ All tests passing (27/27 Agent tests)
✅ CLI tests updated and passing

Key benefits achieved:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable Agent class
- Event-driven presentation layer
- Foundation for multiple interfaces
- Testable components

Ready for Phase 3: Add streaming support to providers and Agent
