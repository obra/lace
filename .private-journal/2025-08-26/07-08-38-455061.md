## Project Notes

The error components are now fully WCAG compliant and optimized:

- **Bundle Size**: All FontAwesome imports now come from the centralized lib/fontawesome.ts, which uses tree shaking to include only needed icons
- **Type Safety**: All error type handling now uses proper ErrorType union instead of generic strings
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements have proper aria-labels for screen readers
- **Testing**: All tests pass and use proper assertions that match actual DOM structure
- **Import Structure**: Clean separation between absolute imports for cross-module references and relative imports for same-directory files

The Turbopack build error seems unrelated to our changes - it's a Next.js/Turbopack internal issue about package resolution. Our component changes are solid since all tests pass and linting is clean.
