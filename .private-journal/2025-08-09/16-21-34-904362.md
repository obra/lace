## Project Notes

Token Aggregation Module Origin:

Created in commit 760d5087 on Aug 8 specifically for the compaction system to analyze token patterns. But it's now being misused in the session API endpoint as the primary way to report token usage.

This explains why there are two parallel token tracking systems that don't agree with each other and neither handles compaction properly.

The session endpoint should be using the Agent's TokenBudgetManager, not recalculating from events using a utility that was meant for compaction analysis.
