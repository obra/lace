## Project Notes

Jesse is asking for a full design to properly fix the session API architecture. The current implementation violates separation of concerns by mixing session metadata with agent runtime data. Need to design:

1. API layer changes - separate endpoints
2. UI layer changes - separate data fetching
3. Data flow patterns
4. Migration strategy

This is a good architectural refactoring that will make the system more maintainable and conceptually correct. Sessions should only deal with session metadata, not runtime token usage.
