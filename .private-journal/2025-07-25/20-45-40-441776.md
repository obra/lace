## Project Notes

Working on Phase 5 of the toolcall architecture fixes. The current implementation has been restored to proper separation of concerns (Agent doesn't create approval requests directly anymore), but there's still semantic confusion in the ToolExecutor.executeTool() method.

Need to implement Task 5.1: Split Tool Permission and Execution
- Add requestToolPermission() method to ToolExecutor
- Simplify executeTool() to only execute (no permission checking)
- Update Agent._executeSingleTool() to call both methods appropriately
- Update Agent._handleToolApprovalResponse() to use new flow
- Remove isPending from ToolResult interface
- Remove createPendingResult helper

Following TDD approach - need to write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to make them pass.
