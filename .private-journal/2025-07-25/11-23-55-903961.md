## Project Notes

Based on my analysis of the Lace settings UI structure, I can see the complete architecture:

**Settings Architecture:**
1. **SettingsContainer.tsx** - Top-level container that manages settings modal state and theme persistence (uses localStorage for theme only)
2. **SettingsModal.tsx** - Modal wrapper with backdrop and close functionality  
3. **SettingsTabs.tsx** - Tab navigation component with keyboard accessibility
4. **SettingsPanel.tsx** - Base panel component for consistent section layout
5. **SettingField.tsx** - Individual field wrapper with labels and descriptions
6. **UISettingsPanel.tsx** - Theme selector panel (uses localStorage via ThemeSelector)
7. **UserSettingsPanel.tsx** - User info panel (NO persistence - comment says "No localStorage - component is stateless except for form state")

**Key Findings for Persistence Notices:**
- Theme settings ARE persisted (localStorage in SettingsContainer and ThemeSelector)
- User settings (name, email, bio) are NOT persisted - explicitly noted as stateless
- Only form state is maintained in memory during the session
- The UserSettingsPanel has a comment on line 45: "// No localStorage - component is stateless except for form state"

**Integration Points:**
- LaceApp.tsx uses SettingsContainer which provides the onOpenSettings callback
- Sidebar.tsx has settings button that calls onSettingsClick
- The settings system is fully integrated into the main app layout
