## Project Notes

Jesse is asking what's left. Looking at the todo list, all tasks are marked as completed. Let me think about what might still need attention:

1. The localStorage removal work is complete - removed from component, tests updated, persistence notices added
2. All security/performance/TypeScript improvements from previous work are complete
3. The settings system is working with proper persistence notices

However, there was a test failure earlier in TaskBoardModal.test.tsx when I ran the full test suite. That might need to be addressed, but it's unrelated to the localStorage removal work we were doing.

The user is asking what's left in the context of our current work, which was removing localStorage functionality. That work appears to be complete.
