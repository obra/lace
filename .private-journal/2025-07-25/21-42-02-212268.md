## Project Notes

The planning document shows "Implementation Complete - All Tests Passing" status. According to my todo list, I have completed all architectural fixes, resolved infinite loops, implemented proper approval workflows, and fixed timing race conditions. All 60 Agent tests are passing. 

The user asked me to update the planning document with current state before running comprehensive tests. The document already reflects this correct status from my previous update.

Looking at the todo list, I have one remaining task in "in_progress" state: "Run comprehensive test suite to verify all fixes" (ID 49). This is the logical next step after updating the planning document.

I should proceed with running the comprehensive test suite as requested, to verify that the architectural fixes haven't introduced any regressions in the broader codebase beyond just the Agent tests.
