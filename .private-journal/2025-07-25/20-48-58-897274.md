## Project Notes

Comparing original agent spawning spec with our delegate tool plan:

**What we've implemented (Phase 1)**:
- Task assignment to "new:provider/model" creates agents ✓
- Agent creation callback in TaskManager ✓
- Basic agent spawning tests ✓

**What's missing from original spec**:
- Agent metadata table and persistence
- Agent.createForTask() factory method  
- Task notification formatters
- Completion notification system
- Thread switching utilities
- Tool filtering for spawned agents
- Integration with task-manager tool

**Key architectural difference**:
- Original spec: Persistent agents via task assignment 
- Our plan: Temporary agents via delegate tool replacement

These are actually complementary - the original spec is about UI-driven agent spawning, while delegate plan is about LLM-driven parallel delegation.
