## Project Notes

Key insight: The failing tests are testing legitimate approval functionality that users depend on. The issue isn't that tests expect approval when they shouldn't - it's that our Phase 5 architectural changes broke the approval workflow. I need to ensure that:

1. Tools that require approval still go through the approval workflow
2. The approval system creates TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST events
3. TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE events properly approve/deny tools
4. The Agent properly handles both immediate execution AND approval workflows

The root issue is likely in how we split requestToolPermission() from executeTool() - we may have broken the approval integration.
