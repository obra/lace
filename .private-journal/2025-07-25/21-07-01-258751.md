## Project Notes

Current state: I've successfully implemented Phase 5 architectural improvements separating requestToolPermission() from executeTool(), and created a helper function createOneTimeToolProvider() to fix infinite recursion in tests. Now I need to systematically apply this pattern to fix the remaining failing tests, starting with the highest priority ones that have 90+ events indicating infinite loops.
