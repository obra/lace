## Project Notes

Key insight: Task tools get TaskManager through factory pattern `createTaskManagerTools(() => taskManager)` while delegate tool tries to get it through context injection. Need to align delegate tool with task tool pattern.

Files involved:
- src/tools/implementations/delegate.ts - needs TaskManager access fix
- src/sessions/session.ts - where tools are registered and TaskManager is injected
- Task tools use factory pattern, delegate tool uses context injection - this mismatch is the bug
