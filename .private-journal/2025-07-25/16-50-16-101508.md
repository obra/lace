## Project Notes

Jesse is asking me to investigate delegation tool initialization errors after studying the multi-agent architecture docs. The error "Delegate tool not properly initialized - missing parent Agent" suggests the current delegate tool isn't adapted for the new multi-agent system.

From reading the docs:
- Multi-agent architecture uses sessions (parent threads) containing agent threads (child threads)
- Current delegate pattern creates temporary sub-agents with parent.1, parent.2 format
- Agent spawning spec extends this to persistent agents triggered by task assignment
- Task-based communication replaces direct agent messaging

The error likely occurs because:
1. Delegate tool expects a parent Agent reference that doesn't exist in new architecture
2. Current delegate implementation may not understand the new thread hierarchy
3. Agent spawning through task assignment ("new:provider/model") might be the right approach

Need to find the delegate tool implementation and see what's broken.
