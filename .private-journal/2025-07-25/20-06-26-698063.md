## Project Notes

Jesse is questioning the design decision where Agent directly creates TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST events. Looking back at the implementation plan and original architecture, this might be incorrect.

Original plan seemed to suggest EventApprovalCallback should create approval requests, but the plan was ambiguous about the exact flow. I may have made the wrong choice by having Agent bypass the approval system entirely.

Need to analyze:
1. What the original plan intended
2. Whether the current design violates separation of concerns  
3. What the correct event-driven flow should be
