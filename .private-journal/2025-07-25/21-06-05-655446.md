## Project Notes

Current implementation analysis shows:

**What we have from original spec**:
- ✅ Task assignment to "new:provider/model" (Phase 1)
- ✅ Agent metadata storage (via thread metadata, not separate table)
- ✅ Agent lifecycle management (via sessions)
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination
- ✅ Real-time updates (via SSE)

**What's different/superseded**:
- Thread metadata instead of separate agent_metadata table
- Web UI instead of thread switching utilities
- Session-based agent management instead of standalone factories
- Task management system integrated into web UI
- Full real-time event system via SSE

**What's missing from original spec**:
- Agent.createForTask() static method (not needed with current architecture)
- Task notification formatters (handled by web UI)
- Thread switching utilities (replaced by web UI)
- Tool filtering for spawned agents (needs to be added)

The current implementation is actually more advanced than the original spec and handles the use cases better.
