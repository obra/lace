## Project Notes

The plan is comprehensive and well-structured. Task 1.1 specifically involves:
1. Making _executeToolCalls non-async (removing await)
2. Adding tool batch tracking with _pendingToolCount and _hasRejectionsInBatch
3. Having Agent go idle immediately after creating tool call events
4. No longer blocking on tool execution

This is the foundation for the event-driven architecture. The current code waits for each tool to complete before moving to the next, but the new approach will fire all approval requests immediately and let tools execute as approvals come in.
