## Project Notes

Root cause analysis of the failing tests:

## Main Issues:

1. **Critical Bug in Agent Event Handler** (line 159 in agent.ts):
   - The event handler is receiving `undefined` events 
   - This happens because `_addEventAndEmit` can return `null` but the event listener assumes it will always get a valid event
   - This is breaking many queue and retry tests

2. **Tool Approval Integration Failures**:
   - Tests expect tools to fail/be denied, but they're succeeding 
   - This suggests the new `requestToolPermission` -> `executeTool` flow is not properly enforcing policies
   - The separation of permission checking from execution may have broken policy enforcement

3. **EventApprovalCallback Tests**:
   - Direct tests are failing because they expect specific error handling that may have changed
   - Some tests are expecting ApprovalPendingError to be caught, but it's being thrown uncaught

4. **Conversation State Tests**:
   - Expecting 'conversation_complete' but getting 'tool_complete:file_list'
   - This suggests the conversation completion flow has changed

## Next Steps:
1. Fix the critical event handler bug that's causing widespread failures
2. Debug the tool approval policy enforcement in the new architecture  
3. Update EventApprovalCallback tests to match new flow
4. Fix conversation completion event emission
