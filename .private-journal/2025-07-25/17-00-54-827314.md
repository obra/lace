## Project Notes

Task 2.1 status: Almost complete. I had successfully implemented the event-driven tool execution handlers in Agent:
- âœ… Added _handleToolApprovalResponse method
- âœ… Added _executeSingleTool method  
- âœ… Added event listener in constructor
- ðŸ”„ Writing tests - 3/4 passing, was fixing approval decision values

The main issues I resolved:
1. MockTool wasn't registered with ToolExecutor - fixed with toolExecutor.registerTool()
2. Wrong parameter format - MockTool expects {action: 'test'} not {command: 'ls'}
3. Wrong approval decision values - ApprovalDecision uses lowercase 'allow_once', 'deny' not uppercase

Next: Run tests to verify all 4 event-driven tests pass, then commit Task 2.1 completion.
