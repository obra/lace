## Project Notes

**Cross-Process Event Propagation Issues**

The migration to Next.js web app has introduced a critical architectural flaw:

1. **SessionService Singleton Pattern**:
   - Uses global.sessionService to persist across HMR
   - But each Next.js process gets its own global
   - activeSessions Map is process-local

2. **SSEManager Issues**:
   - Stores ReadableStreamControllers in memory
   - Client connections bound to specific process
   - No way to broadcast events to clients on other processes

3. **Agent Event Flow**:
   - Agent emits events via EventEmitter (process-local)
   - SessionService listens and broadcasts via SSEManager
   - Only works if agent and client are in same process

The system appears to work in development because often only one process handles requests, but will break in production or under load when Next.js spawns multiple workers.
