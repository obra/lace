## Project Notes

The plan looks technically sound and addresses the core shared state problem in the delegate tool. The approach of replacing direct agent communication with task-based delegation is architecturally consistent. However, there are a few implementation details that need clarification:

1. The polling approach in waitForTaskCompletion() seems inefficient - would be better with events
2. The context access pattern for TaskManager needs to be fleshed out 
3. The agent response handling needs clear integration with existing conversation flow
4. Need to ensure proper cleanup of spawned agents after task completion

The plan correctly identifies the root cause (shared state in DelegateTool) and proposes a clean solution that leverages existing infrastructure. The testing strategy is comprehensive and the risks are well-identified.
