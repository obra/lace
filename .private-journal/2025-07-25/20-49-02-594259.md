## Project Notes

Working on fixing Agent tests after Phase 5 architectural changes. The issue is that tests expect tools to require approval (old behavior with isPending results), but now tools execute immediately when no approval callback is configured.

Key insight: The new behavior is correct. Tools should execute immediately unless blocked by approval system. Need to update test expectations to match this new reality.

Options:
1. Update tests to expect immediate execution (correct approach)
2. Add approval callbacks to tests that expect pending behavior
3. Mix of both depending on what each test is actually testing

Going with option 1 for most tests since immediate execution is the default happy path.
