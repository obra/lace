## Project Notes

Need to revise the delegate tool plan to use event-driven task completion instead of polling. The pattern should be:

1. DelegateTool creates task and sets up event listener for task completion
2. Spawned agent gets instructions to update task when done
3. TaskManager emits events when tasks are updated
4. Parent agent receives notification and can return response

This requires:
- TaskManager events to include creator threadId for filtering
- Clear instructions to spawned agents about task management
- Event listener setup in DelegateTool instead of polling loop
