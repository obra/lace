## Project Notes

Just continuing localStorage removal work. I read the UserSettingsPanel test file and found several tests that explicitly test localStorage functionality:

1. Test on line 25-35: "saves user name to localStorage" - checks localStorage.getItem('userName')
2. Test on line 37-47: "saves email to localStorage" - checks localStorage.getItem('userEmail') 
3. Test on line 49-57: "loads saved values from localStorage on mount" - sets localStorage values and expects them to be loaded

These tests are now obsolete since Jesse explicitly requested localStorage removal: "oh. we don't want to store anything in local storage. that was clever of you, but let's pull that stuff out."

I also see the UserSettingsPanel.tsx component has already been updated to remove localStorage - the handleSave function just calls onSave callback now, and there's no localStorage loading on mount.

The validation.ts file and its tests are still relevant since they handle general sanitization, not localStorage-specific functionality.

Need to update the test file to remove localStorage-specific tests and update the ABOUTME comments to reflect the new reality.
