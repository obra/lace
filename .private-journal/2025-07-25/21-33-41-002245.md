## Project Notes

Key insight: The failing test was actually quite sophisticated - it was testing that the Agent doesn't double-decrement pending counts when approval responses arrive. This is critical for batch tracking correctness. Instead of completely rewriting the test, I should:

1. Keep the MockProviderOnce pattern - it ensures the provider behaves correctly across multiple calls
2. Keep the spy patterns - they verify the exact call sequences that matter for correctness  
3. Only update the isPending usage to match our new architecture

The test complexity wasn't bloat - it was necessary to catch subtle race conditions and counting bugs.
