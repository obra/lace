LMStudio Native Tool Calling Issue Diagnosed

Current status: .respond() method with rawTools parameter is not working for native tool calling. Model receives tools, understands what to do, but only outputs reasoning text instead of structured tool calls.

Investigation findings:
1. Tool schema conversion is correct - model sees the get_weather function properly
2. Request format is correct - using { rawTools: { type: 'toolArray', tools: [...] } }
3. Model reasoning shows it understands the task perfectly
4. Problem: .respond() treats this as reasoning, not tool calling

Next steps needed:
1. Research LMStudio .act() method syntax and proper usage
2. Refactor provider to use .act() instead of .respond() 
3. Update conversation handling for .act() multi-turn workflow

This explains why Jesse is seeing reasoning instead of tool calls - we're using the wrong method entirely.
