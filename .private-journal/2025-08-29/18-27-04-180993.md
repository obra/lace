## Project Notes

Jesse's asking if we need both workflows - good question. Looking at them:

**build-executable.yml:**
- Runs on PR builds and tagged releases
- Builds single executables/DMGs for GitHub releases
- Creates GitHub release artifacts
- Broader scope (PRs + releases)

**build-and-deploy.yml:**
- Runs on main branch pushes and releases
- Builds + deploys to Dropbox for auto-update system
- Sparkle-specific (channels, appcasts)
- Auto-update focused

There's definitely overlap and potential confusion:

**Overlap:**
- Both build DMGs on releases
- Both do code signing
- Both run on releases

**Different purposes:**
- build-executable.yml = GitHub releases for manual download
- build-and-deploy.yml = Sparkle auto-update distribution

**Question:** Do we need both? Could we merge them?

**Answer:** Probably could merge them, but they serve different distribution models:
1. Manual downloads from GitHub releases (build-executable.yml)
2. Automatic updates via Sparkle (build-and-deploy.yml)

Jesse might want to consolidate for simplicity, or keep them separate for different distribution channels.
