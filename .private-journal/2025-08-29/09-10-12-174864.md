## Project Notes

Current state of Lace Playwright testing:

**Infrastructure Quality: A-**
- Excellent isolation (per-test servers, temp dirs, databases)
- Sophisticated API mocking with realistic streaming
- Good helper abstractions available
- Page objects exist and are well-designed

**Code Quality: C+** 
- Massive duplication across 30 test files
- Inconsistent adoption of available patterns
- Mix of good and bad selector strategies
- Timeout chaos without clear standards

**Allowlisted Tests: 19/30 files passing**
This is actually pretty good for E2E tests. The infrastructure is solid enough that 63% of tests are stable in CI.

**Non-allowlisted issues:**
- Complex UI timing problems
- Missing feature implementations
- Race conditions in test setup
- Text-based selector brittleness

**Next Steps for Jesse:**
1. Should focus on consolidating existing patterns, not creating new ones
2. The example.test.e2e.ts file is actually excellent - should be the template
3. Main wins are in reducing boilerplate and enforcing consistent patterns
4. Could probably get to 90%+ pass rate with systematic cleanup

The technical foundation is surprisingly solid for a growing codebase.
