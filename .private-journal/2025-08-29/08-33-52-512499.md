## Project Notes

This review reveals I was sloppy in my cleanup phase. I focused on getting the core fix working but didn't properly clean up all the related code that was broken by the refactor. The reviewer found real compilation issues that would prevent the code from building.

Key areas I missed:
- SessionConfigPanel still has references to removed edit state handlers
- SessionEditModal still uses old non-functional update patterns for sessionConfig
- Inconsistent state ownership between hook and component
- Dead code that should have been removed during refactoring
