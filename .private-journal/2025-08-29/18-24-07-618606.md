## Project Notes

Jesse found another workflow file that I didn't update! There's apparently a separate .github/workflows/build-executable.yml file that's also trying to do signing but doesn't have the keychain setup fixes I applied to build-and-deploy.yml.

The error shows it's failing with "The specified item could not be found in the keychain" which is exactly the same issue we fixed in the other workflow - the certificates aren't being imported into the keychain before signing.

I need to:
1. Find this other workflow file
2. Apply the same keychain setup fixes
3. Make sure both workflows are consistent
