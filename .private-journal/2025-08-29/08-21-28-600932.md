## Project Notes

Analyzed Lace's macOS app architecture:

**Current Setup:**
- Monorepo with TypeScript/Node.js core + Next.js web interface
- Custom Bun-based build system that creates standalone executables
- Swift menu bar app wrapper (platforms/macos/) that manages server process
- Sophisticated build pipeline: build-macos-app.ts creates .app bundles and DMGs
- Already has code signing and notarization pipeline (sign-and-notarize.ts)
- Uses bundle ID: com.jesseVincent.lace

**Build Pipeline Analysis:**
- Bun compiles everything into single executable (lace-server)
- Swift app (Lace) wraps the server and provides native macOS interface
- DMG creation with proper layout and versioning (version-git_sha format)
- Code signing infrastructure already in place
- Clean, professional distribution setup

**Key Insight:** They already have 80% of what's needed for autoupdate. The Swift wrapper app could easily integrate Sparkle framework, and their existing build/signing pipeline would work perfectly with it.

**Architecture Advantage:** The Swift menu bar app is the perfect place to add Sparkle - it's the user-facing component that would handle updates, while the lace-server binary gets replaced during updates.
