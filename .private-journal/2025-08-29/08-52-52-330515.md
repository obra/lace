## Project Notes

Jesse noticed the autoupdate branch is out of date with origin/main which has mac app updates. This is a good catch - we should rebase before continuing with our Sparkle integration work. The changes we've made so far are substantial but it's better to resolve conflicts now than later.

Current state:
- We've added Sparkle framework integration to the Swift app
- Enhanced the UI with settings window
- Modified build scripts
- But the base we're working from is stale

Need to:
1. Check git status to see what we've changed
2. Rebase against origin/main  
3. Resolve any conflicts
4. Continue with our work on the updated base
