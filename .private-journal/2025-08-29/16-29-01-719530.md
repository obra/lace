## Project Notes

Got detailed feedback from an external reviewer (looks like CodeRabbit AI). The feedback covers several important issues:

**GitHub Actions Issues:**
1. Keychain cleanup doesn't restore original default keychain
2. Action versions not pinned to commit SHAs (security risk)
3. Missing workflow permissions, manual trigger, concurrency control

**Sparkle Signing Issues:**
1. XPC services path is wrong (should be Versions/*/XPCServices)
2. Missing Updater.app signing
3. Need proper signing order for all Sparkle components

**Makefile Issues:**
1. Missing .PHONY declarations
2. Should use ditto instead of cp -R for frameworks (preserves symlinks/xattrs)
3. Sparkle version should be pinned, not "latest"
4. Need integrity checks for downloads

**Script Issues:**
1. generate_appcast path resolution bug (doubled path)
2. Dropbox token confusion (refresh vs access token)
3. Missing error handling for existing shared links

Most of this feedback is valid and important for a production system. I should address the critical security and functionality issues.
