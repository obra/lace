## Project Notes

Jesse wants to add a settings screen along with Sparkle integration. This is smart - users need to be able to:
1. Choose between release/nightly channels
2. Configure update frequency 
3. Toggle automatic updates on/off
4. Possibly see current version/channel info

The Swift menu bar app (platforms/macos/) currently just manages the server process, but adding a settings window would be a natural evolution. This also suggests the app is maturing beyond prototype stage.

"lfg" = "let's f*cking go" - Jesse's excited and ready to implement. Good energy for a coding session.
