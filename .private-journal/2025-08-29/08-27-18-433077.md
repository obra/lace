## Project Notes

Jesse wants Sparkle + Dropbox with dual channels:
1. Release channel (stable releases)
2. Every single build channel (continuous deployment)

Key requirements:
- GitHub Actions integration for automated deploy
- Dropbox as hosting (temporary solution for prototype phase)
- Dual channel support in Sparkle

This is actually a sophisticated setup but makes sense for a prototype where they want to test every build internally while having stable releases for broader testing.

Architecture implications:
- Two separate appcast.xml files
- Different Dropbox folders/URLs for each channel
- GitHub Actions that can deploy to both or either channel based on triggers
- Sparkle channel switching (probably via build configuration or user setting)

The existing build system in build-macos-app.ts already has good versioning (npm version + git SHA) which works perfectly for the "every build" channel.
