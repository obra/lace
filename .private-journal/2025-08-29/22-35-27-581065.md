## Project Notes

I've finished reading all 22 E2E test files. Here's what I've found in terms of coverage duplication:

**MASSIVE STREAMING OVERLAP:**
- streaming-basic.e2e.ts
- streaming-error-recovery.e2e.ts  
- streaming-minimal.e2e.ts
- streaming-reliability.e2e.ts
- streaming-sse-events.e2e.ts
- message-streaming.e2e.ts

These 6 files all test essentially the same functionality with slight variations. They all:
1. Setup provider/project 
2. Send messages
3. Wait for AI responses
4. Monitor streaming events/tokens
5. Check interface state

**BASIC MESSAGING OVERLAP:**
- basic-messaging.e2e.ts
- basic-user-journey.e2e.ts
- Both test the same core workflow: setup → create project → send message → verify response

**AGENT/SESSION MANAGEMENT OVERLAP:**
- agent-management.e2e.ts
- session-management.e2e.ts  
- multi-agent-workflows.e2e.ts
These all test very similar URL persistence and state management

**PROJECT CREATION OVERLAP:**
- directory-browser.e2e.ts (tests project creation with directory selection)
- basic-user-journey.e2e.ts (tests project creation as part of journey)
- provider-dropdown-realtime.test.e2e.ts (tests project creation with provider)

**CLEAR CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES:**
1. All 6 streaming tests could be merged into 2-3 tests max
2. Basic messaging + user journey are essentially the same test
3. Agent/session management have 80% overlap
4. Project creation workflows are repeated across multiple files

**UNIQUE VALUE FILES:**
- console-forward.e2e.ts (console forwarding specific)
- data-testid-verification.test.e2e.ts (UI testing specific) 
- error-handling.e2e.ts (error scenarios specific)
- file-browser.e2e.ts (file browsing specific)
- page-objects.test.e2e.ts (page object pattern demo)
- task-management.e2e.ts (task system specific)
- tool-approval.e2e.ts (tool system specific)
- example.test.e2e.ts (documentation/template)

This is a classic case of test sprawl where similar functionality is tested repeatedly with slight variations rather than having focused, comprehensive tests.
