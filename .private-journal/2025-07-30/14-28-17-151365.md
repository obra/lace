## Project Notes

Completed review of web package tests. They're already following best practices:

- Only mock external dependencies (URL fetch, bash, server-only, SSE, database)
- Use real business logic for core functionality (Project, Session, Agent, Tools)
- Proper test setup/teardown with real data flows
- No over-mocking like we initially fixed in the main codebase

The web package tests demonstrate good architecture - they test real behavior while isolating external dependencies. This is exactly what we want.
