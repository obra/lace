## Project Notes

Successfully resolved the delegation timeout issue by fixing the event matching logic in DelegateTool. The problem was that waitForTaskCompletion was checking both task ID AND creator thread ID, but the spawned agent has a different thread ID. Changed to match only on task ID, which fixed the infinite loop.

All delegate tests are now passing. The key files involved:
- /src/tools/implementations/delegate.ts: Fixed event matching in waitForTaskCompletion
- /src/sessions/session.ts: Fixed task ID placeholder issue in formatTaskAssignment
- /src/tools/implementations/delegate-task-based.test.ts: Updated with proper mock provider setup

The system is working correctly now - tasks get created with real IDs, agents get spawned with proper tool instructions, and completion events are properly detected.
