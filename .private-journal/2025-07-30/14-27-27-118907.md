## Project Notes

Looking at the web package tests for refactoring. The session route test already has good structure - it mocks only external dependencies (URL fetch, bash) and server-only compatibility while using real core functionality. The providers route test also looks well-structured with appropriate mocking of the ProviderRegistry. The delegate test files look good with real tool usage.

Key insight: The web package tests are already mostly using real implementations, just need to check if there are any remaining over-mocking issues.
