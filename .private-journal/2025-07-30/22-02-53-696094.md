## Project Notes

Need to complete the icon implementation for success/error indicators in tool headers. Looking at the current state:

1. MessageHeader already accepts icon prop (line 15) but doesn't render it yet
2. ToolCallDisplay shows success/error icons in lines 201-208 but they're in the body area
3. User wants these moved to the header next to tool name and show only checkmark/X icons, not text

Current implementation shows "Success"/"Failed" text next to icons in the body. Need to:
1. Finish MessageHeader to render the icon next to the name
2. Update ToolCallDisplay to pass appropriate icon to MessageHeader  
3. Remove the success/error text display from body area

The icons are already imported: faCheck and faExclamationTriangle
