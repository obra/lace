## Project Notes

Implemented configurable system prompts feature as requested by Jesse:

✅ LACE_DIR environment variable support (defaults to ~/.lace/)
✅ Auto-creation of system-prompt.md with default content
✅ Auto-creation of instructions.md (empty by default)  
✅ Graceful file reading with fallback to defaults
✅ Comprehensive test suite (17 test cases)
✅ Proper TypeScript typing without 'any'
✅ User-friendly messages when config files are created

File structure:
- `src/config/prompts.ts` - Main configuration module
- `src/config/__tests__/prompts.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- Updated `src/agent.ts` to use configurable prompts

Key functions:
- `loadPromptConfig()` - Main entry point, returns PromptConfig
- `getPromptFilePaths()` - Helper for getting file locations
- Auto-creates ~/.lace/system-prompt.md and ~/.lace/instructions.md

The system now supports:
- Custom system prompts for different use cases
- User-specific instructions (currently unused but available)
- Environment-based configuration directory
- Helpful first-run experience with file creation messages

Integration works seamlessly - no breaking changes to existing functionality. Tests verify edge cases like permission errors, missing directories, multiline content, etc.
