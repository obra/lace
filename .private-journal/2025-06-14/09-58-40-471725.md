## Project Notes

Analyzed the Lace2 codebase comprehensively. This is a clean, well-structured AI coding assistant with:

Key Architecture:
- Main CLI interface in agent.ts orchestrates everything
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules:
  - Core Agent (agents/agent.ts) - Anthropic API wrapper
  - Thread Management (threads/) - Event-based conversation storage
  - Tool System (tools/) - Extensible tool registry and execution
  - Conversation Builder - Converts events back to Anthropic format

Design Patterns:
- Event-sourcing for conversations (events stored in threads)
- Registry pattern for tools
- Builder pattern for conversation reconstruction
- Not singleton - agents can be instantiated multiple times

Thread System:
- Events are the core data model: USER_MESSAGE, AGENT_MESSAGE, TOOL_CALL, TOOL_RESULT
- ThreadManager is pure data layer - no business logic
- Conversation builder reconstructs Anthropic messages from events
- Events have proper sequencing and validation

Tool Architecture:
- Tool interface is model-agnostic
- Registry manages tool discovery
- Executor handles safe execution with error handling
- BashTool is first implementation with structured JSON output

Testing:
- Vitest for testing framework
- Good test coverage for conversation builder
- Tests use real event structures from actual usage
- Coverage reporting configured

Development Setup:
- TypeScript with ES modules
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Husky for git hooks
- Build pipeline outputs to dist/

Key Insights:
- Very clean architecture following YAGNI principles
- Event-sourcing enables conversation resumability
- Tool system is extensible and well-designed
- Code follows consistent naming conventions
- Good separation between data layer and business logic
