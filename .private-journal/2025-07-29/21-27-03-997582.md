## Project Notes

Critical issue: CSS compilation failing on Node v20 with same URL scheme error we thought we fixed. The error shows:

"TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL_SCHEME]: The URL must be of scheme file"

This is happening during webpack CSS compilation. The Tailwind v4 import syntax fix didn't resolve this for Node v20. Need to investigate Node version compatibility with Tailwind v4 imports.
