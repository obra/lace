## Project Notes

Key finding: The correct Turbopack workaround is NOT using `root` config (that's deprecated/invalid). Instead, need to use `resolveAlias` to manually duplicate the tsconfig paths mapping. 

The error shows the alias is working: "Import map: aliased to server relative '/Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/lace/src/utils/logger'" but then fails because "server relative imports are not implemented yet."

Need to try a different resolveAlias configuration approach - maybe without the trailing slashes or different path format.
