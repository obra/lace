## Project Notes

Jesse wants Turbopack despite the complexity. The GitHub issue provides the exact solution: add `root: '..'` to Turbopack config to allow cross-package imports. This is a legitimate workaround for monorepo setups like ours where packages need to import from parent directories.

Need to:
1. Add `root: '../..'` to point to lace root
2. Update package.json to use Turbopack
3. Test that CSS and path resolution both work
