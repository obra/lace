## Project Notes

Now I can see the current state clearly. The failing test is "should create task with new agent assignment" and it's failing due to a missing ANTHROPIC_KEY environment variable during agent spawning. The test needs to either:

1. Mock the agent spawning process completely to avoid needing real API keys
2. Set up the environment variable for tests
3. Use a different approach that doesn't require real agent creation

Looking at the test structure, it's using real TaskManager integration with a mockAgentCreator, but the issue is that somewhere in the agent spawning process, it's still trying to create a real agent that requires the ANTHROPIC_KEY.

The problem is likely in the agent creation flow where despite having a mock, there's still some code path that requires the real environment variable. I need to check the agent creation process to understand where this dependency comes from.

The test error suggests the issue is in the agent spawning behavior where it needs to create actual agents, but the test environment doesn't have the API key configured. This is happening in the TaskCreateTool execution when it tries to spawn an agent for the "new:anthropic/claude-3-haiku" assignment.

From the context, it looks like Jesse wants real integration tests with minimal mocking, but we still need to handle the API key requirement sensibly in tests.
