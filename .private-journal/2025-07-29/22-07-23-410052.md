## Project Notes

CRITICAL FINDING: The CSS URL scheme error we've been seeing is fixed in Node.js PR #55471, merged October 22, 2024. This fixes the "The URL must be of scheme file" error by adding fallback handling for non-file URL schemes in the ESM module system.

The fix is in Node.js 20.18.3+ and 21+. We're currently on 20.18.1, so we need to upgrade to at least 20.18.3 to get this fix.

This explains why:
1. Tailwind v4 CSS imports were failing
2. The error was Node version-specific
3. Turbopack wasn't the root cause - it was a Node.js ESM bug
