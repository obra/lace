## Project Notes

New runtime error: POST /api/threads/[threadId]/message getting "Unexpected end of JSON input" at JSON.parse(). This means:

1. Request body is empty or malformed
2. Frontend sending requests without proper JSON content
3. Could be related to the form submission or API call logic

Need to investigate the message route handler and see how it's being called from the frontend.
