## Project Notes

Key insight: Lace uses a custom server (server.ts) instead of standard Next.js dev server to enforce single-process mode. This means we need to ensure:
1. CSS compilation happens automatically on changes
2. Static assets are served correctly
3. Hot reloading works for CSS

The custom server might not be handling CSS compilation/serving the same way as Next.js dev server.
