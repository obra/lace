## Project Notes

Turbopack path resolution issue: The `~` alias pointing to project root isn't working. Need to check:
1. Turbopack resolveAlias configuration 
2. tsconfig.json path mapping
3. Make sure both are aligned

Current error: Can't resolve '~/utils/logger' - suggests Turbopack isn't using the same path resolution as TypeScript.
