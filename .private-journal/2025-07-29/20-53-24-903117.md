## Project Notes

Issue: Complete CSS loss in Lace web UI after clearing node_modules and restart. All styling gone, looks like unstyled HTML. This suggests build process or asset serving problem.

From screenshot: Can see HTML structure (sidebar, sessions, tasks) but zero CSS styling applied. This is not a minor styling issue - it's complete CSS failure.

Need to check:
- Next.js build process
- CSS/Tailwind setup
- Static asset serving
- Development server config
