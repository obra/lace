## Project Notes

Major learning: Turbopack in 2024 still has fundamental limitations with "server relative imports" - this is a known unimplemented feature. The error "server relative imports are not implemented yet" appears when:

1. Using path aliases that resolve to absolute paths in server-side contexts
2. Instrumentation.ts imports (our case)  
3. Complex monorepo setups with cross-package imports

The original CSS issue was just Tailwind v4 syntax - needed double quotes instead of single quotes for @import and @plugin directives. Webpack works fine with the path aliases.

Lesson: Don't switch to bleeding edge bundlers (Turbopack) for production codebases unless there's a compelling reason. Stability > performance in most cases.
