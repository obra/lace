## Project Notes

Error: ERR_INVALID_URL_SCHEME when compiling globals.css through webpack CSS loader and PostCSS loader. This suggests:
1. Invalid URL in CSS (could be font imports, asset references)
2. PostCSS plugin configuration issue  
3. Tailwind v4 import syntax issue
4. Asset resolution problem

Need to check globals.css for any URL references that might be causing this.
