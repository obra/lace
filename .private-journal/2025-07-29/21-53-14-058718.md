## Project Notes

This GitHub issue (#71886) describes the exact problem we hit with Turbopack:

1. Import aliases outside project directory don't work with Turbopack
2. Our `~/` alias points to `../../src` (outside web package directory)
3. Workaround mentioned: add `root: '..'` to Turbopack config
4. Tim Neutkens explains it's intentional - Turbopack prevents access to files outside project directory

This confirms our decision to stick with webpack was correct, but also gives us a potential path forward for Turbopack if needed.
