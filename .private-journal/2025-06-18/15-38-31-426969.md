## Project Notes

Examined Lace provider system for auto-detection patterns:

CURRENT STRUCTURE:
- All providers extend AIProvider abstract class with standardized interface
- Each provider has providerName getter for identification
- File naming: `{provider-name}-provider.ts` pattern consistent
- Export pattern: direct export of provider classes in index.ts
- Manual registration in cli.ts createProvider() function

DISCOVERED PATTERNS FOR AUTO-DETECTION:
1. Consistent naming: All providers follow *Provider class naming
2. Standard interface: All extend AIProvider base class
3. File naming: kebab-case with -provider.ts suffix
4. providerName property: Each has unique string identifier
5. Located in single directory: src/providers/

KEY INSIGHTS FOR AUTO-DETECTION:
- TypeScript compilation to JS makes runtime reflection possible
- File system scanning + dynamic imports could work
- Base class check ensures proper interface compliance
- providerName property enables automatic registration mapping

POTENTIAL APPROACHES:
1. File system scanning + dynamic import
2. Build-time code generation 
3. Registry decorator pattern
4. Module enumeration at runtime

Most promising: File system approach with glob pattern matching and dynamic imports, then filter by instanceof AIProvider check.
