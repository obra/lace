## Project Notes

Phase 3 Terminal Interface Implementation Complete! 

Successfully completed all Phase 3 improvements:

✅ **MessageDisplay Component**:
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks with language detection
- Message type prefixes (👤 User, 🤖 Assistant, 💭 Thinking, 🔧 Tool, ℹ️ System)
- Proper timestamp display
- Streaming cursor support for real-time feedback
- Full test coverage (8/8 tests passing)

✅ **StatusBar Component**:
- Positioned right above input area per user feedback
- Inverse styling instead of bordered box (cleaner look)
- Shows provider/model, thread ID (full, not truncated), message count, token usage
- Processing status indicator (⚡ Processing / ✓ Ready)
- Smart token formatting (2.5k for large numbers, exact for small)
- Full test coverage (10/10 tests passing)

✅ **Enhanced Terminal Interface**:
- Integrated both new components seamlessly
- Connected to Agent event system for real-time updates
- Token usage tracking via token_budget_warning events
- Maintained all existing functionality (approval modals, streaming, etc.)
- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- Proper React/Ink component design patterns
- Event-driven UI updates without complex state management
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage with timezone-aware assertions
- Performance-optimized rendering

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Much clearer message formatting with syntax highlighting
- Real-time system status visibility
- Better visual hierarchy and information density
- Professional terminal interface feel

All tests passing (18/18 for new components), builds successfully, ready for user testing. The terminal interface now provides a significantly enhanced user experience while maintaining the clean, event-driven architecture of Lace2.
