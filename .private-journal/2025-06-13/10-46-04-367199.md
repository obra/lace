## Project Notes

FIXED: Anthropic API error when tool messages were included in LLM requests!

Problem: We save tool execution records with role `'tool'` for UI display, but Anthropic API doesn't accept `'tool'` role messages.

Solution: Filter out `'tool'` messages in `Conversation.getFormattedMessages()` so:
✅ UI sees complete conversation including tool executions  
✅ LLM API only receives valid `'user'` and `'assistant'` messages
✅ No API errors on subsequent requests

Architecture working perfectly:
- Agent saves intermediate steps (thinking + tool executions + final response)
- Conversation stores everything chronologically
- UI displays everything  
- LLM API gets filtered valid messages only

Clean separation of concerns achieved!
