## Project Notes

MAJOR SUCCESS: Fixed the tool output display issue! The conversation flow now works exactly as intended:

✅ User message
✅ Assistant thinking message  
✅ Tool execution with real input/output (not "No output available")
✅ Final assistant response

The fix was adding `toolResult.stdout` to the result extraction logic in Agent.generateResponse(). Shell tool returns `{stdout, stderr, exitCode}` but we were only checking for `result|output|data|content`.

Architecture is solid: Agent → Conversation → UI chronological display.

Minor cleanup needed:
- Remove duplicate final assistant message
- Remove redundant Agent Activity section (tool calls now properly inline)

The core problem is solved - we have proper tool call visibility in conversation flow.
