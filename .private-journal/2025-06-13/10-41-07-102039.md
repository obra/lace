## Project Notes

Working on fixing tool execution display in conversation flow. Successfully implemented architectural separation where Agent saves intermediate steps to Conversation, and UI displays chronologically. Current issue: tool output shows "No output available" instead of actual command results (like the "date" command output). 

The conversation flow now correctly shows:
1. User message: "what time is it?"
2. Assistant thinking: "I'll use the shell command to check the current time."
3. Tool execution: Shows shell command with input but wrong output
4. Final assistant response: Shows correct time

Still need to fix the tool result extraction to show proper command output instead of "No output available".
