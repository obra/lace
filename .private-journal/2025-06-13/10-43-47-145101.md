## Project Notes

FIXED: Duplicate assistant message issue! 

Root cause: We were saving the assistant response twice:
- Once in `generateResponse()` (thinking message before tools)  
- Once in `processInput()` (final response after generateResponse completes)

Solution: Removed the duplicate save in `processInput()` since our new architecture has `generateResponse()` handle all conversation persistence.

Current flow should now be clean:
✅ User message
✅ Assistant thinking message  
✅ Tool execution with real output
✅ Single final assistant response (no duplicate)

Still remaining: Remove redundant "Agent Activity" section since tool calls are now properly displayed inline.
