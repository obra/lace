## Project Notes

Major mistake: Broke the working application while doing architectural refactoring. Jesse is rightfully frustrated.

**Current Status:** App won't start, tests broken
**Priority:** Get app running again ASAP

**Critical issues to fix:**
1. Agent class likely has broken method signatures  
2. UI components expecting old conversation state management
3. Missing integrations between new Conversation class and existing code

**Lesson learned:** Should have made incremental changes and tested at each step, not big-bang refactoring. Jesse's instructions emphasize working software over architectural purity.

Need to quickly get back to a working state, then make smaller, safer changes if needed.
