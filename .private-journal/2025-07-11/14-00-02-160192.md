## Project Notes

The Lace codebase has a sophisticated architecture with several key components:

1. **Provider Architecture**: Clean abstraction layer with AIProvider base class, registry system, and pluggable providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, LMStudio, Ollama). The registry already includes a 'test-provider' case that imports from utils/mock-provider.js.

2. **Event-Driven Agent System**: Agent class uses EventEmitter pattern with states (idle, thinking, streaming, tool_execution). It communicates with providers through standard createResponse/createStreamingResponse methods.

3. **Test Infrastructure**: Uses Vitest with jsdom environment. Has existing TestProvider class that extends AIProvider and provides configurable mock responses. Tests use LACE_TEST_MODE environment variable.

4. **Network Layer**: Already has fetch interception infrastructure for HAR recording via fetch-interceptor.ts. This shows the codebase can handle network-level mocking.

5. **Thread Management**: Event-sourcing architecture with SQLite persistence and graceful degradation to memory-only mode.

6. **CLI Integration**: The app.ts creates providers through ProviderRegistry.createProvider() method, which already handles the 'test-provider' case.

Key insight: The architecture is already set up for provider-level mocking through the test-provider case, but it's limited and only used for simple test scenarios. The existing fetch interception shows they understand network-level mocking concepts.

Architecture patterns I need to analyze:
- Provider-level mocking (already partially implemented)
- Network-level mocking (infrastructure exists)
- Test-mode providers (basic implementation exists)
- Service injection patterns
- Environment-based switching

The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, making it suitable for sophisticated mock server integration.
