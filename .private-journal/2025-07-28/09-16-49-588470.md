## Project Notes

Compaction system legacy cleanup completed successfully:

- Removed all string TOOL_RESULT support from trim-tool-results strategy  
- Made conversation builder strict about ToolResult object validation
- Updated all tests to use proper ToolResult format: `{id: string, content: [{type: 'text', text: string}], isError: boolean}`
- Error messages are clear and descriptive
- All 62 thread tests passing
- System is now "tighter" as requested by Jesse

This was a good example of systematic legacy removal - tests updated first, then implementation made strict, then verification of clean error handling.
