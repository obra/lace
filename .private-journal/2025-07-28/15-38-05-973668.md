## Project Notes

The debugging shows that:
- Agent correctly emits 6 `thread_event_added` events
- Test spy receives all 6 events  
- But SessionService SSE forwarding never triggers (broadcastSpy never called)

This means the SessionService `setupAgentEventHandlers` is either:
1. Not being called for this agent
2. Being called on a different agent instance
3. The event handlers are not working correctly

Need to verify that the SessionService actually attaches event handlers to the same agent instance the test uses.

The key insight is that the Agent event emission is working perfectly - the problem is definitely in the SessionService event handling setup or processing.
