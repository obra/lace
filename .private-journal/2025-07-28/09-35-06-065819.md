## Project Notes

This is a sophisticated TypeScript/Node.js project called "Lace" - an AI coding assistant with event-sourcing architecture. Key architectural elements:

1. **Event-Sourcing**: Immutable event sequences stored in SQLite that can reconstruct conversation state
2. **Three-Layer System**: Data Layer (ThreadManager/Persistence), Logic Layer (Agent/Tools), Interface Layer (Terminal/Web/API)
3. **Tool Approval System**: Event-driven approval workflow with database constraints to prevent race conditions

From the plans, I can see they've been working on fixing tool approval race conditions with a defense-in-depth approach:
- Database unique constraints to prevent duplicate approval events
- Atomic operations in ThreadManager.addEvent()
- Agent-level guards against duplicate execution
- Conversation builder deduplication

The planning documents show most tasks are complete, with only one remaining: auditing void async operations that should be awaited. This is important because improperly handled async operations can cause database connection errors and other race conditions.

The codebase uses strict TypeScript, has comprehensive testing with Vitest, and follows YAGNI principles. The architecture seems well-designed with proper separation of concerns.
