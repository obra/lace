## Project Notes

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the issue now. When multiple tool calls are made in one message (like bash and file_find), the UI is only showing one tool block instead of both. The timeline conversion logic might be incorrectly aggregating or overwriting multiple tool calls from the same message. Need to investigate how TOOL_AGGREGATED events are created and ensure each tool call gets its own timeline entry.
