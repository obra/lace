## Project Notes

Current status: We successfully implemented Agent.threadId to return ThreadId branded type, eliminating the need for manual asThreadId() conversions. Fixed most failing tests by adding proper session context setup with useTempLaceDir().

Two remaining failing tests to address:
1. flib/server/agent-utils.test.ts 
2. components/ProjectSelectorPanel.test.tsx

Need to run these tests to see specific failure modes, then apply appropriate fixes based on the patterns already established.
