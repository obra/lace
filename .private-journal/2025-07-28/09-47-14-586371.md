## Project Notes

Looking at the database connection errors in event-approval-callback.test.ts. I already fixed one test ("should emit agent events when creating approval requests") but there are 2 more failing tests:

1. "should create TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST when Agent executes tool requiring approval" - Line 123: expect(toolCallEvent).toBeDefined(); failing 
2. "should handle tool execution denial through Agent flow" - Line 174: expect(approvalRequestEvent).toBeDefined(); failing

The issue is that these tests are expecting events to be found but they're returning undefined. This suggests the MockProviderWithToolCalls or the agent flow isn't working as expected in these specific tests.

Looking at the test structure, all tests use the same setup but only 2 are failing. The working test has proper waiting and agent.stop() cleanup. The failing ones might need similar fixes.

Key insight: The error messages show "expected undefined to be defined" which means the events aren't being created at all, not that they're being created with wrong data. This suggests a timing or flow issue.
