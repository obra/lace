## Project Notes

Current test status based on summary:
- ✅ Database connection errors - FIXED with stopAllAgents()
- ✅ Tool approval flow tests - FIXED by correcting requestApproval parameters  
- ✅ Missing getToolCallEventByIdForThread method - FIXED by switching to integration tests
- ⚠️ SessionService integration tests - Mock provider not being used, calls real Anthropic
- ⚠️ ProjectSelectorPanel test - UI component test failure

The pattern that's working: Mock external dependencies (filesystem, database, SSEManager) but use real business logic (Session, Agent, ThreadManager). This gives more realistic testing while avoiding external calls.
