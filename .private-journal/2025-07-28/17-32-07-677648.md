## Project Notes

Critical regression discovered: Tool approval dialogs not showing in web interface.

Error: "Tool 'file_list' not allowed in current configuration"

This suggests our recent changes broke:
1. Tool policy configuration lookup
2. Session context passing to tool system
3. Approval workflow integration

Need to investigate:
- How tool policies are resolved from project configuration
- How session context flows through to tool execution
- Whether EventApprovalCallback is being invoked
- SSE event delivery for approval requests

This is likely related to our Agent.threadId type changes or session security requirements.
