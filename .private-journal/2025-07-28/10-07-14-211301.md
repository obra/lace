## Project Notes

Converting packages/web/lib/server/session-service.test.ts from mock-based to integration tests to fix missing getToolCallEventByIdForThread method. The user explicitly requested switching to "a real integration test" and using "src/test-utils/temp-lace-dir.ts" for proper setup. 

Key changes made:
- Added useTempLaceDir() for proper test persistence setup
- Created TestProvider instead of mocking everything
- Using real Session, Agent, ThreadManager instances
- Mocking only external dependencies (Project.getById, ProviderRegistry.getProvider)
- Real event emission through actual agent instances
- Proper cleanup with agent.stop() and timeout

This should resolve the method missing error since real Agent instances have the getToolCallEventByIdForThread method that SessionService calls.
