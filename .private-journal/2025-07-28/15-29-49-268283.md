## Project Notes

Current issue: ToolExecutor security tests are failing because tools aren't being registered properly in the test setup. The test creates a real session, gets the coordinator agent, and uses its tool executor, but the tool executor doesn't have tools registered.

The pattern in the code shows:
1. Create session via Session.create()
2. Get coordinator agent via session.getAgent(session.getId())
3. Use agent.toolExecutor
4. But the toolExecutor doesn't have tools registered

Need to debug whether:
- The coordinator agent's tool executor is properly initialized
- The registerAllAvailableTools() call is working
- There's some other issue with tool registration in the test setup

The security logic looks correct - it's properly checking for session context and would throw the right errors if tools were registered.
