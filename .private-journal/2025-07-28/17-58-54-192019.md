## Project Notes

Looking at the current code state after implementing the Configure Session button fix:

**Current Implementation Status:**
- Added `userWantsSessionConfig` state flag to prevent auto-selection interference
- Both mobile and desktop Configure Session buttons now set this flag before clearing selectedAgent
- Auto-selection useEffect respects this flag to avoid immediately re-selecting agent
- Flag gets reset when session changes to allow normal auto-selection behavior

**Debug Logging Currently Present:**
- Console.log statements in both mobile (line 620-623) and desktop (line 766-769) Configure Session button clicks
- Debug logging in render decision area (line 870-875) 
- Debug logging in approval modal render (line 943-953)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- userWantsSessionConfig state is defined on line 214
- Auto-selection useEffect checks this flag on line 218
- Flag reset on session change is on lines 224-226
- Mobile button handler on lines 619-627
- Desktop button handler on lines 765-772

**Technical Architecture:**
The solution uses a state flag pattern to coordinate between multiple useEffect hooks that were competing. This is cleaner than trying to modify the dependency arrays or add complex conditions to the auto-selection logic.

**Next Steps:**
Should test this implementation and then remove debug logging once confirmed working. The userWantsSessionConfig approach should prevent the auto-selection from interfering when user manually navigates to session config.
