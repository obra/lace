## Project Notes

The SessionService approval test was the original failing test that led me to discover the session context security flaw. Now that I've fixed:

1. Made ToolContext.session mandatory
2. Fixed Agent to pass session context to tools
3. Added fail-safe security in ToolExecutor

This test should now work properly. The test creates a real session, gets the agent, and tries to trigger tool approval by having the agent execute a tool call.

Key issues to fix:
- Tool name should be `file_write` not `file-write`
- Missing mockSSEManager reference should use broadcastSpy
- Test design looks solid - uses real components with temp directory pattern

This is a good integration test that validates the full approval flow from Agent → ToolExecutor → EventApprovalCallback → SSE forwarding.
