## Project Notes

## COMMON-TASKS.md Issues

1. **Lines 51-63**: COMPLETELY WRONG location for tool registration
   - Doc claims tools are registered "Around line 200+ in Session.createAgent()"
   - Reality: Tools are registered in `Session.initializeTools()` at lines 845-867
   - The example code is misleading developers

2. **Lines 343-364**: Session and Agent creation patterns
   - Need to verify if these methods actually exist with these signatures
   - The example shows session.createAgent() but needs verification

3. **Line 92-95**: LaceEvent union type pattern shown is outdated
   - The actual code uses a discriminated union pattern differently
   - Need to check the actual implementation

4. **Tool implementation example looks correct** but should verify the actual patterns used

5. **API endpoint example** - need to verify if getAgent() function exists in agent-manager

### Patterns that seem accurate:
- Zod schema usage patterns
- Tool base class extension pattern  
- Error handling with ToolResult
- Testing patterns with tmpdir
- SSE streaming setup
