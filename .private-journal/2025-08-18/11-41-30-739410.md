## Project Notes

## CODE-MAP.md Issues

1. **Line 174**: Claims to "Look for `Session.createAgent()` method to see tool registration"
   - WRONG: No such method exists
   - Tools are registered in `Session.initializeTools()` not createAgent()

2. **Line 237**: Again claims tool registration is in "createAgent() method"
   - FALSE: It's in initializeTools()

### Things that look accurate:
- File structure appears correct
- Import patterns (~/  and @/) are correct
- Key file locations seem right
- Database and persistence locations
- API route structure looks correct
- Critical files section seems accurate

The CODE-MAP is mostly accurate except for the wrong references to createAgent() for tool registration.
