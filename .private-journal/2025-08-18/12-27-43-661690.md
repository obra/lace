## Project Notes

Architecture docs should focus on:
- System structure and component relationships
- Design patterns and principles
- Data flow and interactions
- Key abstractions

NOT:
- Specific method signatures
- Interface field details
- Exact return types
- Line-by-line API documentation

The subsystem docs are trying to be API reference docs when they should be explaining architecture.
