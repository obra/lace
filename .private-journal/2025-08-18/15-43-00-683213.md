## Project Notes

What would make these docs useful:
1. Specific architectural decisions and their rationale
2. Real constraints and how they shaped the design
3. Actual event flows with concrete examples
4. Integration patterns that are unique to Lace
5. Things that would surprise a developer - non-obvious design choices

What to remove:
- All "Future Enhancements" sections (fabricated)
- Generic best practices
- Vague performance claims
- Duplicate content
