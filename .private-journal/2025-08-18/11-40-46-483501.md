## Project Notes

## GOTCHAS.md Issues

### MAJOR FABRICATIONS:

1. **Lines 7-19**: Wrong API for addEvent()
   - Doc shows: `threadManager.addEvent(threadId, 'TOOL_RESULT', resultData)`
   - Reality: `threadManager.addEvent(event)` - takes full event object, not separate params
   
2. **Lines 85-92**: Methods that don't exist
   - `agent.waitForIdle()` - NO SUCH METHOD
   - `agent.sendMessage()` - Need to verify if this exists
   
3. **Lines 229-233**: More non-existent methods
   - `agent.waitForIdle()` mentioned again - doesn't exist
   
4. **Lines 245-250**: Non-existent methods
   - `agent.clearQueue()` - need to verify
   - `agent.reset()` - need to verify

5. **Lines 60-74**: Wrong tool.execute() signature
   - Shows passing `{ threadId, messageId }` as context
   - Actual context is `{ threadId, signal, workingDirectory? }`

6. **Lines 95-108**: getAllEvents() vs getEvents() 
   - Need to verify if getAllEvents() actually exists and what it does

### Things that look accurate:
- Event ordering issues are real
- Immutability of events is correct
- Provider-specific format differences
- SSE connection limits
- File path issues (relative vs absolute)

### Need to verify:
- SessionService and its event handling
- setupTestDatabase() utility
- Compaction behavior
