## Project Notes

## Quick Reference Docs Assessment

### GOTCHAS.md
- About 40% fabricated methods (waitForIdle, sendMessage, reset, etc.)
- Wrong API signatures throughout
- BUT: Core concepts about event ordering, immutability, state machine issues are valid
- Many of the gotchas ARE real (SSE limits, provider formats, etc.)
- VERDICT: Salvageable with heavy editing

### ERROR-PATTERNS.md  
- Similar issue - many fabricated methods
- Wrong addEvent signature throughout
- BUT: The error messages and causes are mostly real
- Provider-specific errors are accurate
- Database errors are real
- VERDICT: Salvageable with method fixes

### COMMON-TASKS.md
- Tool registration completely wrong
- Some API patterns wrong
- BUT: Zod schema patterns correct
- Testing patterns mostly correct
- SSE setup accurate
- VERDICT: Salvageable with fixes

### QUICKSTART.md
- Tool registration wrong location
- Missing event types
- BUT: Overall architecture description good
- File locations accurate
- Event flow correct
- VERDICT: Salvageable with minor fixes

### CODE-MAP.md
- Just two wrong references to createAgent()
- Everything else accurate
- VERDICT: Easy to salvage - just 2 line fixes
