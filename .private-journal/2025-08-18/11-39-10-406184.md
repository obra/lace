## Project Notes

## Architecture Doc Review Issues Found

### QUICKSTART.md Issues

1. **Line 85-94**: Claims tools are registered in `Session.createAgent()` around line 200+. This is FALSE. 
   - Tools are actually registered in `Session.initializeTools()` at lines 845-867
   - The createAgent method doesn't register tools at all

2. **Line 82**: Lists tools in a different categorization than what's in the code
   - Doc shows "workflow tools" but code doesn't categorize them this way
   - Missing categorization of task-manager tools as a distinct group

3. **Line 38-44**: Event types list is INCOMPLETE
   - Missing 'SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION' event type (present in types.ts line 41)
   - The doc should match the actual EVENT_TYPES array

4. **Session vs Agent hierarchy explanation** seems correct but needs verification of actual behavior

5. **Line 24**: States `src/providers/registry.ts` handles provider discovery - need to verify this file exists and does what claimed

### Need to verify:
- Does ProfiledDatabase wrapper exist as stated in line 273-276?
- Token management imports and usage patterns
- The state machine transitions actually work as documented
