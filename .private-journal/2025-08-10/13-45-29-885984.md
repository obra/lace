## Project Notes

Current TokenBudgetManager removal status:

PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Minimal usage found:
- packages/web/app/api/compaction.e2e.test.ts (lines 205-212, 359, 372)
- packages/web/app/api/projects/[projectId]/token-budget/route.ts (entire file)

Key insight: TokenBudgetManager appears to be optional/dead code already. The Agent class may have `tokenBudgetManager` as optional property but doesn't rely on it for core functionality.

Next: Need to examine Agent class to understand if TokenBudgetManager is truly optional or if there's hidden coupling.
