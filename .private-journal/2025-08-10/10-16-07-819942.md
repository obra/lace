## Project Notes

User reports that the token usage display is not showing in the Lace app interface. I need to debug why the TokenUsageSection component I added to LaceApp isn't rendering.

Possible issues:
1. selectedAgent state not populated correctly
2. Conditional logic preventing rendering 
3. useAgentTokenUsage hook not returning data
4. Component errors preventing render
5. CSS/styling issues hiding the component

I should check the browser console, verify the selectedAgent value, and trace through the component logic.
