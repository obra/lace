## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to analyze what code changes would be needed beyond just updating the TokenUsage type definition. Key areas to examine:

1. Where TokenUsage objects are created in the core
2. Where token budget/context limit information is calculated
3. How agent.getTokenUsage() works and what it returns
4. Whether TokenBudgetManager already has the needed data
5. What needs to change to populate the additional fields

I should trace through the actual implementation to understand the full scope of changes needed.
