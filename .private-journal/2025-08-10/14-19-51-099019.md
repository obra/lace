## Project Notes

TokenBudgetManager chainsaw operation is now 100% complete with all tests passing! 

Final test results: 119 passed, 2 skipped (integration tests for external services), 1404 total tests passed.

The key fixes applied:
- **agent-token-api.test.ts**: Removed conflicting getAvailableModels() override, used proper thread creation with threadManager.createThread()
- **retry-integration.test.ts**: Added getAvailableModels() mock methods to all provider mocks  
- **agent-auto-compact.test.ts**: Updated test expectation to match new behavior (no cooldown - compact every time threshold exceeded)

The simplified direct token tracking system is working correctly:
- Agent.getTokenUsage() calculates directly from thread events using aggregateTokenUsage()
- Gets context limits from provider.getAvailableModels()
- Auto-compaction triggers at 80% usage without cooldown complexity
- All vanity metrics (eventCount, lastCompactionAt) successfully removed

~500 lines of complex budget management code eliminated while maintaining all functionality.
