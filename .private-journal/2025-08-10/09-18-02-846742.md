## Project Notes

Jesse wants to work on the token usage hook next. Key requirements:
- NEVER poll for tokens
- Get tokens on load OR from SSE events
- We have existing useTokenUsage.ts and useEventStream.ts hooks
- Need to combine these approaches properly

This aligns with the token usage display component I created earlier - it needs real-time token data from SSE events, specifically from AGENT_MESSAGE events which now include tokenUsage thanks to the type consolidation work.

The architecture should be: API call on initial load → SSE events for updates → no polling ever.
