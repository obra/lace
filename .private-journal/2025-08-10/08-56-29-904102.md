## Project Notes

The user wants to start the type consolidation work that we've been planning. Key points:
- Start with "easy stuff" 
- Update callers rather than renaming during re-exports
- Make small commits
- Several files were modified since the conversation was compacted

My current todo list shows 13 tasks for this consolidation work. I should start with the simplest ones and work systematically.

From my analysis, the main duplications are:
1. AgentMessageEventData vs core AgentMessageData
2. ToolCallEventData vs core ToolCall 
3. ToolApprovalRequestData toolAnnotations vs core ToolAnnotations

The files that have been modified need to be re-examined to see what changes were made.
