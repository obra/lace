## Project Notes

TokenBudgetManager removal is now 100% complete across all packages!

Final status:
- **Core tests**: 119 passed, 2 skipped, 1404 total tests ✅
- **Web tests**: 92 passed, 802 total tests ✅  
- **All tests passing**: No failures remaining ✅

The final fix was updating the compaction E2E test token counts:
- Changed from 9,500/12,000 (79%) to 160,000/200,000 (80%) 
- Matches Claude 3.5 Sonnet's actual 200k context window
- Auto-compaction now triggers correctly at 80% threshold

The simplified token management system is fully operational:
- Direct ThreadTokenUsage calculation from events
- Provider-based context limits via getAvailableModels()  
- Clean 80% auto-compaction threshold without cooldown complexity
- All vanity metrics removed (eventCount, lastCompactionAt)
- ~500 lines of TokenBudgetManager complexity eliminated
