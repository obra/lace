## Project Notes

TokenBudgetManager removal scope expanded significantly after Agent analysis:

CURRENT FINDINGS:
- 21 references to _tokenBudgetManager in Agent class 
- Core integration points: token budget checks, usage recording, auto-compaction trigger
- Public API methods that will need removal/replacement

NEXT ACTIONS:
- Need to understand what ThreadTokenUsage data is available to Agent
- Need to identify alternative token recording mechanism 
- May need to implement getTokenUsage() method returning ThreadTokenUsage
- Auto-compaction logic already has threshold config (_autoCompactConfig.threshold = 0.8)

RISK: This is more architectural surgery than simple deletion. Need to ensure alternative token tracking exists.
