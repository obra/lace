## Project Notes

Successfully fixed the approval timeout issue! The root cause was that the EventApprovalCallback had a hardcoded 10-second timeout that was designed for tests but was being used in production. This was way too short for users to see and respond to approval modals, especially if they needed to refresh the page.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Made timeout configurable**: Updated the EventApprovalCallback constructor to accept a configurable timeout parameter with a sensible default of 5 minutes (300,000ms) for production use.

2. **Environment-based timeout**: Modified the web integration layer to use a 10-second timeout in test environments (NODE_ENV === 'test') and the 5-minute default for production.

3. **Better error messages**: Updated the timeout error message to include the actual timeout duration for better debugging.

## Key Changes:

- `src/tools/event-approval-callback.ts`: Made timeout configurable with 5-minute default
- `packages/web/lib/server/agent-utils.ts`: Added environment-based timeout selection (10s for tests, 5min for production)

## Result:

- All 433 tests still pass
- 0 linting errors
- Users now have 5 minutes to respond to approval requests instead of 10 seconds
- Tests still complete quickly with the 10-second timeout
- The approval system should now work much better in the live system

This was a critical bug that made the approval system nearly unusable in production. The fix maintains backward compatibility while making the system practical for real-world use.
