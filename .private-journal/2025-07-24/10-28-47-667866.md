## Project Notes

Mapped Lace approval system flow:

1. Tool execution triggers agent 'approval_request' event
2. SessionService handler calls ApprovalManager.requestApproval()
3. ApprovalManager creates UUID requestId, stores Promise resolve function, broadcasts TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST via SSE
4. Client useSessionEvents receives event, sets approvalRequest state  
5. LaceApp renders ToolApprovalModal
6. User clicks decision → POST /api/approvals/[requestId] → ApprovalManager.resolveApproval()

The system works perfectly for happy path but fails on browser refresh/multiple approvals because:
- Client state is ephemeral (approvalRequest gets cleared on reconnect)
- Server state is disconnected from new connections (no way to query pending approvals)
- Architecture assumes single approval at a time

Need to either:
1. Make server expose pending approvals to new connections, OR
2. Make approval requests persistent/recoverable, OR  
3. Add approval request queuing/batching
