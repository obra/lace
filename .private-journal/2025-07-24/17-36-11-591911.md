## Project Notes

Two issues to debug:

1. **Onboarding chain navigation failing**: 
   - Should navigate directly to chat with Lace agent
   - Instead goes back to project list
   - Need to check console logs to see if `handleOnboardingComplete` is being called
   - Might be an issue with React state updates or routing

2. **Sidebar context not loading**:
   - Shows "No conversation data loaded. 0 entries."
   - Current Project shows but no session/agent context
   - This suggests the `selectedSessionDetails` isn't being loaded properly
   - Might be related to the `loadSessionDetails` useEffect not triggering correctly

The flow should be:
1. Create project → onboarding chain → direct navigation to chat
2. If manual selection: project → session config → select agent → chat

But it seems like:
1. Create project → back to project list (onboarding broken)
2. Manual selection → agent loads but sidebar broken

Need to check the debug logs and the session loading logic.
