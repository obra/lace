## Project Notes

I'm continuing work on fixing the approval recovery issue after Jesse refreshed the page during a pending tool approval request. The issue is that the approval modal doesn't reappear after page refresh.

From my analysis of the codebase, I can see:

1. `useSessionEvents.ts` at line 107 is listening for `TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST` events
2. `LaceApp.tsx` shows approval modals when `approvalRequest` state is set
3. The new event-based system emits `TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST` events through the Agent
4. There are new API endpoints for handling approvals and getting pending approvals

The core issue is that when the page refreshes, the web interface loses its in-memory state, but there's no recovery mechanism to check for existing pending approvals. I need to add logic to check for pending approvals on page load/session connection.

Looking at the test files, I can see the event-based approval system is working correctly - it creates `TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST` events and stores them in the ThreadManager. The web interface just needs to be updated to recover this state.

Key files to update:
- `useSessionEvents.ts` - add recovery mechanism to check pending approvals on connection
- `LaceApp.tsx` - might need API endpoint fix (currently uses `/api/approvals/[requestId]` instead of `/api/threads/[threadId]/approvals/[toolCallId]`)

This is a critical user experience issue that prevents the approval system from working properly after page refreshes.
