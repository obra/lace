## Project Notes

Looking at the issue - the user's console logs show that the onboarding chain is working perfectly. All the debug logs show:
1. Project creation successful
2. Session fetching successful  
3. handleOnboardingComplete called with correct parameters
4. Navigation state set successfully

But the user still sees the project list instead of the chat interface. This suggests the issue is in the conditional rendering logic in LaceApp, not in the onboarding chain itself.

The key lines to examine are around line 822 in LaceApp.tsx - the conditional logic that determines when to show:
- Loading spinner (lines 815-821)
- Chat interface with agent (lines 822-851) 
- Session config panel (lines 852-867)
- Project selector panel (lines 869-884)

The condition `selectedProject && foundProject` needs to be true to show the chat interface, but there might be a timing issue where foundProject isn't being set properly when handleOnboardingComplete runs.
