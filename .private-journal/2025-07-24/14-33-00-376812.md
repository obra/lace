## Project Notes

Looking at the Sidebar.stories.tsx file, I can see the issue. The story file is still using the old Sidebar interface that included `currentTheme` and `onThemeChange` props, but we removed those when we updated the Sidebar component to use the settings system instead. 

The SidebarWrapper component in the stories is passing:
- currentTheme={props.currentTheme || currentTheme}
- onThemeChange={handleThemeChange}

But the actual Sidebar component now expects:
- onSettingsClick={() => {}}

This is causing a mismatch between what the stories expect and what the component actually accepts. I need to update the stories to use the new SettingsContainer pattern and remove the old theme-related props.
