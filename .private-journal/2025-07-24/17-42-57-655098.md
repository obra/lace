## Project Notes

The user is saying that was AFTER my fix, meaning the loadProjects() call I added didn't work. The projects array is still empty even after calling loadProjects().

This suggests that either:
1. loadProjects() is async and hasn't completed yet when the debug log runs
2. There's an issue with the loadProjects() function itself
3. The timing is wrong - we need to wait for loadProjects() to complete before proceeding

I need to make the handleOnboardingComplete function async and await the loadProjects() call, or find another solution to ensure the project is loaded before trying to render.
