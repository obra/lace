## Project Notes

The user reports several issues after my fixes:

1. **Onboarding chain broken**: Should navigate to chat, but goes back to project list instead
2. **Duplicate agent creation**: Two agents created instead of one  
3. **Sidebar not populating**: Sessions and agents don't show in sidebar

Issues to investigate:
- `handleOnboardingComplete` callback might not be working
- `ProjectSelectorPanel` onboarding chain might have errors
- Double agent creation suggests the onboarding API calls might be firing twice
- LaceApp session/agent loading logic needs checking

The flow should be:
Project creation → Session auto-created → Agent created via API → Navigate to chat

But it seems like it's:
Project creation → Back to project list → Manual project selection → Multiple agents created → Sidebar broken
