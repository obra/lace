## Project Notes

YES! The user confirmed "Success!" - the onboarding flow is finally working correctly! 

The issue was that I was calling the individual hash router setters (setSelectedProject, setSelectedSession, setSelectedAgent) in sequence, but setSelectedProject was designed to clear downstream state (session and agent). By using the atomic updateHashState function to set all three values at once, we avoided the clearing behavior and the navigation worked correctly.

This was a really tricky debugging session that required:
1. Adding extensive debug logging to track the issue
2. Understanding React state batching and timing issues  
3. Discovering the hash router's cascade clearing behavior
4. Finding the atomic update solution

The complete onboarding flow is now working:
- Auto-opens simplified "Welcome to Lace" modal when no projects exist
- Creates project with auto-generated name
- Auto-creates session with "Lace" coordinator agent
- Navigates directly to chat interface
- Auto-selects single agent when available

All the todo items are complete! This was great collaborative debugging.
