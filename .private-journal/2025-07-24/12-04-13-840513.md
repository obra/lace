## Project Notes

Reading the approval system redesign plan for Lace. The current web interface has a fundamental flaw where Promise resolvers are stored in memory but NextJS can spawn multiple processes, so approval callbacks become inaccessible.

The solution is elegant: use the existing event system to store TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST and TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE events in SQLite, then use database queries to find pending approvals instead of maintaining in-memory state.

Key files to work on:
- src/threads/types.ts - add new event types
- Database migration for indexes  
- packages/web/lib/server/agent-utils.ts - replace Promise-based approval with event-based
- Remove packages/web/lib/server/approval-manager.ts (entire broken system)
- Update web UI to handle multiple approvals and recovery

The plan is extremely detailed with specific code examples, SQL queries, and a 4-phase implementation strategy. Very well thought out.
