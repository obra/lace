## Project Notes

Successfully completed fixing the web package ThreadManager tests. The issue was that the tests were calling `setCurrentThread()` method which doesn't exist in our current stateless ThreadManager implementation. 

Fixed 3 test files:
1. lib/server/thread-manager-delegate.test.ts
2. lib/server/thread-manager-caching.test.ts  
3. lib/server/session-spawn-agent.test.ts

Changes made:
- Removed all `setCurrentThread()` calls from test setup and test cases
- Updated test descriptions to reflect stateless nature (no more "current thread" concept)
- Updated type interfaces to remove setCurrentThread from expected method signatures
- Tests now properly reflect that ThreadManager is stateless and doesn't maintain current thread state

All web package tests now pass (424 tests passing). All core compaction tests also pass. The Phase 2 compaction system implementation is fully complete with all reviewer feedback addressed and all test failures fixed.

Final status: âœ… Complete - Phase 2 compaction events system implemented, all tests passing, ready for merge.
