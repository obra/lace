## Project Notes

The web package has linting errors related to highlight.js usage after our dependency cleanup. The errors are all about unsafe assignments and member access on what TypeScript thinks is an `error` type, which suggests the highlight.js import is failing or returning an error instead of the expected library object.

Files affected:
- components/files/FileDiffViewer.tsx
- components/ui/CodeBlock.tsx  
- components/ui/InlineCode.tsx

All errors are @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-* rules complaining about unsafe usage of what should be highlight.js methods like .highlight(), .highlightAuto(), .value, .language properties.

This suggests we removed highlight.js as a dependency but the web frontend still expects it to be available.
