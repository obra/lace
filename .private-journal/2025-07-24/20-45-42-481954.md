## Project Notes

Now I can see the issue clearly! The logs show:

1. Project gets created successfully (POST /api/projects 201)
2. handleOnboardingComplete is called correctly
3. loadProjects() is called and completes
4. BUT "Projects reloaded, new count: 0" - the projects array is still empty!
5. This means loadProjects() is not actually populating the projects state
6. The server logs show GET /api/projects 200 requests, so the API is working
7. But somehow the React state isn't being updated

This suggests there's an issue with the loadProjects() function itself or a React state update timing issue. The loadProjects() function is calling the API successfully but not updating the projects state.

I need to check if there's an issue with the loadProjects function or if there's a race condition where the state update hasn't taken effect yet when we check projects.length.
