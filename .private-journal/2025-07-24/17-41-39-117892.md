## Project Notes

Jesse wants another UX improvement - when clicking on a session that has only one agent, skip the session config panel and go straight to the chat interface. This makes sense since there's no choice to make if there's only one agent.

This requires modifying the handleSessionSelect function to check if the selected session has exactly one agent, and if so, automatically select that agent to go straight to chat.
