## Project Notes

Completed a comprehensive search for dead code patterns in the lace codebase after terminal frontend removal. Found several categories:

1. HIGH PRIORITY: StreamingTimelineProcessor and timeline-types are only used in tests and one debug command
2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Debug commands for UI features that no longer exist (debug-focus, debug-timeline-layout, debug-ui-performance)
3. LOW PRIORITY: Test setup files still importing React testing library, old test data JSON files with ink references, commented TerminalInterface references

Most surprisingly, the codebase is actually quite clean - the ink removal was done thoroughly. The main dead code is concentrated around the timeline processing system that was used for the terminal UI.
