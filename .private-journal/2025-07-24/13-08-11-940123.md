## Project Notes

Completed comprehensive Ink.js cleanup for LACE project:

Technical achievements:
- Removed 12 unused dependencies: @inkjs/ui, ink, ink-autocomplete, fullscreen-ink, react, react-dom, @types/react, marked-terminal, pino, pino-pretty, cli-highlight, clipboardy, highlight.js, sax, @types/glob, @types/marked, @types/sax, node-pty, execa
- Eliminated StreamingTimelineProcessor (~376 lines) and related timeline infrastructure
- Removed timeline-types.ts interfaces and updated token-estimation.ts to remove dependencies
- Cleaned up orphaned use-stdout-dimensions.ts utility
- Removed docs/working-with-ink.md
- Simplified test-setup.ts from React setup to minimal placeholder

Console capture lessons:
- Global console capture in test-utils was causing import errors after removal
- Better approach: targeted per-test console capture only where needed
- LMStudio timeout test needed optional console verification since providers may not always log errors
- CLI flow tests needed comprehensive console capture (log, error, warn) to suppress help messages
- Provider validation tests produce expected error messages that should appear in stderr

Test quality improvements:
- Identified and removed meaningless tests that only checked `expect(true).toBe(true)`
- Found smoke tests in app.test.ts and cli-flow.test.ts that provided no value
- All remaining tests now have proper assertions and test real functionality

Architecture insights:
- Event-driven architecture made cleanup easier - no complex UI state to unravel
- Provider abstraction layer isolated changes well
- Tool system remained unaffected by UI removal
- ThreadManager/persistence layer completely independent of UI choices

Systematic approach worked well:
- Batched dependency removal with testing between each batch
- Committed frequently to maintain working state
- Linting and formatting after each change
- Separate commits for deps vs code cleanup vs test improvements

Final state: 1,125 unit tests passing cleanly, no console noise, proper error capture where needed.
