## Project Notes

The auto-open project creation modal is triggering correctly (since Jesse sees it when there are no projects), but it's showing the wrong UI. The simplified mode logic I implemented isn't working properly. I need to debug why `isSimplifiedMode` isn't evaluating to true when `autoOpenCreate={true}` is passed to the ProjectSelectorPanel.

Looking at my implementation:
```typescript
const [showAdvancedOptions, setShowAdvancedOptions] = useState(false);
const isSimplifiedMode = autoOpenCreate && !showAdvancedOptions;
```

The issue might be that the autoOpenCreate prop isn't being passed correctly, or the conditional rendering logic isn't working as expected. The modal should show "Welcome to Lace" title and only the directory input field in simplified mode.
