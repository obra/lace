## Project Notes

Perfect! The debug logs show exactly what I suspected. The onboarding chain is working correctly:

1. ProjectSelectorPanel finds the session and calls onboardingComplete
2. handleOnboardingComplete is called with correct parameters  
3. BUT the projects array is empty: `Current projects array: []`

This confirms the issue - when handleOnboardingComplete runs, the newly created project hasn't been loaded into the projects array yet, so foundProject is false and the condition `selectedProject && foundProject` fails.

The fix of calling `loadProjects()` in handleOnboardingComplete should resolve this. The user should see the projects array populate after the reload, and then the conditional rendering should work correctly.

There are also some 404 errors for the task API that need to be addressed - the useTaskManager is trying to fetch tasks with invalid project/session IDs (null values).
