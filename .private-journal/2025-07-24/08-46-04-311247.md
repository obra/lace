## Project Notes

Starting a dead code cleanup task for the lace codebase. The user wants me to find remnants from a removed terminal frontend, focusing on:
1. ink/terminal/console references
2. unused imports
3. completely unused files
4. commented code blocks
5. obsolete UI utilities
6. obsolete CLI configuration

This is a systematic cleanup task that requires careful analysis to avoid breaking working code.
