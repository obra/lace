## Project Notes

Looking at this screenshot, I see that a project was successfully created (since we're now in the session selection view), but several of my earlier implementations aren't working:

1. **Session date formatting (Task 1)**: Shows "Session 7/24/2025, 4:55:43 PM" instead of "Thursday, Jul 24"
2. **Agent name (Task 4)**: Likely not showing "Lace" as the default name
3. **Default model (Task 2)**: Probably not using claude-sonnet-4-20250514

The issue might be that:
- My changes were in the core library classes (`src/sessions/session.ts`, `src/projects/project.ts`) 
- But the web UI might be using different API endpoints that bypass these changes
- Or the default session creation in project creation might not be using the updated logic

I need to trace through the actual project creation flow to see where the disconnect is.
