## Project Notes

The user is showing the initial app load state which looks correct - loading spinner showing "Loading..." and debug logs showing the expected initial state. The app is properly showing the project selection interface when there are no projects.

Next step is for them to create a project to test if my fix for the projects array loading issue works. I've:

1. Made loadProjects() return the loaded projects array
2. Updated handleOnboardingComplete to await the projects load and use the returned array
3. Added detailed debug logging to track the issue

The key things to watch for in the next test:
- Whether loadProjects() actually returns projects 
- Whether the onboarding navigation works correctly
- Whether the foundProject logic now works properly
