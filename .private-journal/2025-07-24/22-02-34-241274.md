## Project Notes

Looking at the 4 failing tests I need to fix:

1. `/packages/web/app/api/projects/route.test.ts` - "should handle empty name" test expects validation error but now auto-generates name
2. `/packages/web/components/TaskBoardModal.test.tsx` - expects "task board" but modal shows "Project Tasks" 
3. `/packages/web/e2e/web-ui.test.ts` - expects coordinator agent named after session but now always "Lace"
4. `/packages/web/app/full-flow.test.ts` - similar coordinator agent naming issue

These are straightforward expectation updates to match the new auto-naming behavior.
