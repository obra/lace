## Project Notes

Root cause of CI lint failure discovered and fixed:

Problem: During Ink.js cleanup, I removed `highlight.js` from root package.json, but the web package components still imported `import hljs from 'highlight.js'`. Without the dependency, TypeScript treated the import as an `error` type, triggering @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-* warnings.

Files affected:
- packages/web/components/files/FileDiffViewer.tsx
- packages/web/components/ui/CodeBlock.tsx  
- packages/web/components/ui/InlineCode.tsx

Solution: Added `highlight.js` and `@types/highlight.js` to the web package's own dependencies since that's where they're actually used.

Key lesson: When removing dependencies from a monorepo root, check all packages to ensure they don't import those dependencies. Each package should declare its own dependencies rather than relying on hoisting from root.

The web package was using highlight.js for syntax highlighting in code blocks, which is a legitimate use case that should be preserved.
