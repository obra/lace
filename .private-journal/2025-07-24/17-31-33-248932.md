## Project Notes

Major architectural misunderstanding on my part:

**What I implemented**: 
- Project creation → Session with coordinator agent → Separate "Lace" agent via onboarding chain
- Result: Two agents (coordinator + Lace)

**What should happen**:
- Project creation → Session with coordinator agent named "Lace" 
- Result: One agent (coordinator named "Lace")

The server logs show the onboarding chain is working fine:
- POST /api/projects 201 ✅
- GET /api/projects/4aa755c6-30e7-489c-ae81-d3a9c8437ec2/sessions 200 ✅  
- POST /api/sessions/lace_20250725_498wzg/agents 201 ✅

But I need to:
1. Remove the agent creation from the onboarding chain
2. Make the coordinator agent get named "Lace" when the session is created
3. Update the navigation to go directly to the coordinator agent, not a spawned agent

The issue is in Session.create() - the coordinator agent needs to get the "Lace" name.
