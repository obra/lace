## Project Notes

Current web structure:
- Sessions are already first-class (parent threads)
- Agents are child threads within sessions
- No projects or users yet
- Session metadata (names) only in memory, not persisted
- Clean event-driven architecture that can be extended
- Need to add: users table, projects table, update threads table with metadata fields
- API routes need user context and access control
