## Project Notes

Jesse clarified this is a single-user system with local webui for now. Multi-user is v2. This significantly simplifies the initial implementation - no auth needed, just need to add the project layer and properly persist session/agent metadata. Can design with future multi-user in mind but don't need to implement auth/tenancy yet.
