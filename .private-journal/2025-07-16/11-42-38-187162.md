## Project Notes

Critical insights after deeper analysis:

1. SessionService singleton is NOT a limitation - it's just a service layer that manages multiple Session instances
2. Sessions are runtime constructs - threads are the persistent entities
3. Configuration is stored as metadata on threads (isSession, name, provider, model)
4. The system ALREADY supports multiple concurrent sessions!
5. What's missing:
   - Project layer above sessions
   - Project-level configuration that sessions inherit
   - Session/thread configuration beyond just provider/model

The architecture is more flexible than I initially understood. The singleton is just for HMR support in Next.js dev mode.
