## Project Notes

The database migration issue is in Task 1.3. The migrateToV6() method in src/persistence/database.ts is missing the project_id column addition. Looking at the test failure, it shows that session_id was added properly but project_id is missing. The migration code needs to be updated to include:

```typescript
// Add project_id to threads table
const hasProjectId = (this.db.prepare(
  "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM pragma_table_info('threads') WHERE name='project_id'"
).get() as { count: number }).count > 0;

if (!hasProjectId) {
  this.db.exec('ALTER TABLE threads ADD COLUMN project_id TEXT');
}
```

The Thread interface already has projectId defined, and ThreadManager.createThread() accepts projectId as a parameter, so this is just a missing database schema piece.
