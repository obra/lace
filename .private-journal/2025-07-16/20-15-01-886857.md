## Project Notes

Key discovery about ESLint configuration:
- `.lintstagedrc` runs `eslint --fix` during pre-commit
- `@typescript-eslint/require-await` rule cannot be auto-fixed by ESLint 
- The specific error is in `/packages/web/lib/server/session-service.ts:376` where there's an async arrow function that doesn't await anything
- This is likely a legitimate async function for tool approval, so the async keyword is intentional
- Jesse specifically asked to "figure out the eslint behaviour" rather than work around it

This explains why `eslint --fix` isn't resolving the issue - because this particular rule cannot be automatically fixed.
