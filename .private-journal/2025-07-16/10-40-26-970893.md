## Project Notes

Database design decisions:
- JSON blobs for project configs (flexible, whole-config loading)
- Concurrency concern: two instances reading, making unrelated changes, overwriting each other
- Keep it simple (YAGNI) - maybe just version number or last-write-wins for now
- Using Zod for all schemas and validation (important architectural decision)
