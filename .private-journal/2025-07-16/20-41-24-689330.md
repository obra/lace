## Project Notes

Updated bash tool working directory behavior per Jesse's request. The tool now properly uses context.workingDirectory when available instead of always using process.cwd(). This aligns with how other tools in the system handle working directory context, making the bash tool behavior consistent with file operations tools.

The tests are comprehensive and cover all edge cases. The implementation is clean and maintains backward compatibility.
