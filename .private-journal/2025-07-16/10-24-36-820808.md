## Project Notes

Jesse mentioned:
1. Git worktrees support - sessions can override project working directory
2. Ephemeral sessions in temp directories - maybe via a default project
3. IMPORTANT: Agents should NEVER change working directory on their own

This suggests a hierarchy:
- Project has base working directory
- Session can override with its own (e.g., worktree, temp dir)
- Agent operates within session's directory (or project's if no override)
- Working directory is immutable during agent execution
