## Project Notes

Current issue: Tool approval callback isn't working in web UI despite being set up correctly. Agent reports "Tool execution requires approval but no approval callback is configured" when trying to execute tools.

Key files involved:
- /packages/web/lib/server/session-service.ts - setupApprovalCallback method
- /src/app.ts - CLI approval callback setup for comparison
- E2E tests show session/agent creation working but approval callback failing

Need to debug why the callback isn't being recognized by the tool executor despite being set up in setupApprovalCallback.
