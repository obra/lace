## Project Notes

Project-level configurations Jesse mentioned:
- Tool restrictions/blanket approvals (v1 priority)
- Default models/providers for different agent classes
- Custom hooks on events (future)
- Environment variables per project
- Project-specific API keys/tokens/URLs for providers

Not all needed for v1, but design should accommodate future expansion.
