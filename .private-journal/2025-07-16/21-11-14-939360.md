## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to implement this multi-project architecture. Current status:

**COMPLETED (âœ…)**:
- Task 1.1: Database schema with sessions table
- Task 1.2: Session persistence methods
- Task 1.3: ThreadManager session support  
- Task 1.4: Working directory in ToolContext
- Task 1.5: Tools using working directory
- Task 1.7: Agent working directory support

**NEXT PRIORITY**:
- Task 1.6: Session Class Project Support

**REMAINING**:
- Task 1.8: Web API project endpoints
- Task 1.9: Session API endpoints  
- Task 1.10: Basic web UI

The Session class (Task 1.6) is the bridge between the old API and new architecture. It needs to:
1. Accept projectId parameter in create()
2. Store sessions in sessions table instead of thread metadata
3. Get working directory from project hierarchy
4. Update getAll() to use sessions table

This is a focused refactoring task with clear test specs. Should be straightforward to implement.
