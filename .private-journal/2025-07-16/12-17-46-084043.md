## Project Notes

Jesse wants to deprioritize CLI and simplify. Key insight: we're building for the web interface, not CLI. This changes things:

Simplifications:
1. No CLI changes needed
2. Focus on web-first design
3. Minimal viable implementation
4. Add complexity only when needed

Core essentials:
- Projects table
- project_id on threads
- ProjectManager for CRUD
- Working directory in ToolContext
- Simple config (just provider/model?)

Can defer:
- Complex config inheritance
- Tool policies  
- Fancy migration system
- CLI integration
