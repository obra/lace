## Project Notes

Jesse's asking about the API path inconsistency. Currently the spec has:
- Agents nested under sessions: /api/sessions/:id/agents/:agentId
- But sessions NOT nested under projects: /api/sessions/:id (not /api/projects/:id/sessions/:id)

This is inconsistent! If we're establishing a hierarchy (projects → sessions → agents), the API paths should reflect that. Either:
1. Fully nested: /api/projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId/agents/:agentId
2. Flat with relationships: /api/sessions/:id, /api/agents/:id (with project/session IDs in the body)

The current mix is confusing.
