## Project Notes

Found the issue: when we updated the Session class to use global persistence, there are many other places in the codebase that still create ThreadManager instances with dbPath parameters, but the ThreadManager constructor now expects 0 arguments since it uses global persistence internally.

This means we need to update all ThreadManager constructor calls throughout the codebase to remove the dbPath parameter. The errors show this affects:
- Many test files (agent tests, cli tests, etc.)
- The main agent.ts file
- Various other components

The key issue is that ThreadManager used to accept a dbPath parameter but now uses getPersistence() internally, so all new ThreadManager() calls should have no parameters.
