## Project Notes

Looking at the current state after reading the files:

Task 4 (improve tool descriptions) is in progress but I can see the work has been completed:
- src/tools/implementations/task-manager/tools.ts has comprehensive enhanced descriptions for all 6 task tools
- src/config/prompts/sections/tools.md has detailed workflow guidance added
- src/tools/implementations/task-manager/description.test.ts has quality tests

The files are read and staged for commit based on the summary. Need to complete the commit and move to Task 5.

Task 5 is about comprehensive integration testing. I can see there are already integration tests:
- src/tools/delegate.test.ts - tests DelegateTool functionality
- src/delegation-integration.test.ts - tests delegation workflow integration

The plan specified creating `src/tools/implementations/task-manager/workflow.integration.test.ts` with end-to-end testing of the improved task management system. This would test complete workflows from task creation through delegation to completion, validating the architectural improvements made in Tasks 1-4.
