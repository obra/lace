## Project Notes

Successfully resolved the modal chaining bug where approval modals wouldn't automatically refresh after submitting a decision. The root cause was missing TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE event forwarding in the session service.

The fix involved:
1. Writing failing tests to verify the bug
2. Adding TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE handling to setupAgentEventHandlers
3. Following TDD properly with test-first approach
4. Making an atomic commit with descriptive message

This demonstrates the importance of comprehensive event forwarding in event-driven systems. The approval workflow consists of both REQUEST and RESPONSE events, and both need to be forwarded to the UI for proper state synchronization.

The test coverage now includes both the existing TOOL_APPROVAL_REQUEST behavior and the new TOOL_APPROVAL_RESPONSE forwarding, ensuring the modal chain works correctly.
