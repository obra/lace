## Project Notes

The parallel tool implementation appears to be largely complete based on my review. Key remaining tasks from the todo list:

1. Message processing updates for rejected tool results 
2. Event ordering in conversations
3. Message queue integration for post-rejection user messages
4. Integration tests and timing fixes
5. Batch completion scenario tests
6. Provider contract compliance tests

The core architecture transformation is done - tools no longer block, approvals are event-driven, and the Agent can handle parallel execution. The remaining work is mostly about ensuring proper message flow and comprehensive testing coverage.
