## Project Notes

Looking at the new tool-use updates plan vs the previous delegate-with-tasks plan. Key observations:

1. The new plan is very implementation-focused (bulk task creation, fallback code removal, model updates, description improvements) while the previous plan was more architectural (solving parallel delegate execution conflicts).

2. The current delegate tool implementation appears to already be task-based (using TaskManager, task creation, event-driven completion) - so the architectural problem from the old plan seems solved.

3. But there are some concerning aspects in the new plan:
   - The ~200 lines of "dead fallback code" - this suggests backwards compatibility cruft
   - Outdated model references (haiku-latest vs specific versions)
   - Basic tool descriptions without workflow guidance
   - No bulk task creation for efficient planning

4. Looking at current code:
   - delegate.ts: Already task-based, uses TaskManager, waits for completion events - good architecture
   - task-manager/tools.ts: Has fallback patterns that bypass session architecture
   - tools.md: Very basic descriptions, lacks workflow guidance

The new plan addresses real technical debt but misses some bigger picture issues I can see.
