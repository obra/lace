## Project Notes

Analyzed the codebase for logging configuration and setup. Key findings:

## Current Logging Infrastructure

### 1. DebugLogger (/src/logging/debug-logger.js)
- Configurable logger with dual output (stderr + file)
- Log levels: debug, info, warn, error, off
- Takes options: {logLevel, logFileLevel, logFile}
- Thread-safe file writing with write queue
- Currently used throughout the system

### 2. ActivityLogger (/src/logging/activity-logger.js) 
- SQLite-based forensic audit trail
- Always-on logging to .lace/activity.db
- Tracks user inputs, agent responses, model calls, tool executions
- Event emitter for real-time streaming
- Has logEvent method that takes (eventType, localSessionId, modelSessionId, data)

### 3. Model Provider Logging (/src/models/model-provider.js)
- Has basic LLM request/response logging built-in
- Logs to debugLogger if provided: request info, response info, errors
- Tracks timing, token usage, content lengths
- Line 46-58: logs LLM requests with provider/model/messages/tools info
- Line 68-77: logs LLM responses with success/duration/tokens/content info

### 4. Anthropic Provider (/src/models/providers/anthropic-provider.js)
- No specific logging configuration beyond what ModelProvider does
- Does have sessionId tracking (line 15, 123-124)
- Extensive streaming handling but no extra logging

## Configuration Patterns
- No centralized logging config file found
- Configuration passed via constructor options throughout
- Agent.ts constructor takes debugLogger option
- ModelProvider takes debugLogger in config
- No environment variable configuration spotted

## Missing LLM Logging Details
- No dedicated LLM request/response file logging
- Activity logger could capture model calls but would need integration
- No structured logging of full request/response payloads
- No separate log files for LLM interactions specifically
