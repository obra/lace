## Project Notes

The ActivityLogger fix was architectural - the issue was that the test's mock start() method bypassed laceUI.initialize() while still trying to use logging methods. Jesse correctly identified that silencing the error would be "a hack, not a good architectural fix" when I suggested it. The proper solution was to ensure the mock start() method calls the real initialization.

The no-mocks philosophy is important in this codebase - tests in ./test/no-mocks/ should use real implementations wherever possible, only mocking expensive external dependencies (APIs) and infrastructure that doesn't work in test environments (UI rendering).
