## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to analyze whether the three registry systems (tools, agents, models) feel cohesive and use the same patterns. After studying them, I can see:

**Common Patterns:**
- All use Map-based registries for plugin management
- All have standardized interfaces for their components
- All support dynamic lookup and instantiation
- All integrate with the broader agent system

**Inconsistencies:**
- Tool registry uses abstract base class + schema pattern
- Agent registry uses static role definitions + metadata
- Model registry uses provider pattern + interface conformity
- Naming conventions vary: `getSchema()` vs role properties vs provider methods

The delegation tool redesign suggests adding `usage_guidance` to tool schemas and simplifying parameters. This could be a good opportunity to align all three systems around consistent patterns.
