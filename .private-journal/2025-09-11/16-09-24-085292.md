## Project Notes

Jesse has identified the specific gaps in the current agent creation API that need to be filled:

1. Persona support exists in core but not exposed in web API
2. No initial message support at all

His suggested approach:
- Extend CreateAgentRequest interface 
- Update API validation
- Pass persona to spawnAgent call
- Send initial message after agent creation using existing logic
- Follow TDD approach

This is incremental API enhancement following existing patterns. Need to look at api.agents.$agentId.message.ts for message sending patterns.
