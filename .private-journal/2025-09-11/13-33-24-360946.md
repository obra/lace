## Project Notes

This is an implementation plan for adding agent creation from the sidebar via a chat-widget style modal. The plan is well-structured and follows the project's architectural patterns.

Key implementation details:
- 10 tasks with clear dependencies
- TDD approach with comprehensive testing
- Reuses existing components (ModelSelector, SidebarSection pattern)
- Smart defaults: default persona + current chat's model
- Chat-widget UX instead of traditional form

The plan correctly identifies integration points:
- PersonaRegistry for persona data
- useAgentManagement for agent creation
- Existing modal patterns and components
- SidebarSection component structure

Testing strategy is comprehensive:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for data flow
- E2E tests for user scenarios
- Error handling and loading states

Should validate some assumptions before starting:
- PersonaRegistry API availability
- Existing chat input components
- Current AgentsSection structure
- useAgentManagement hook API
