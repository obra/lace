## Project Notes

Great clarification! The modal should have smart defaults: default persona = default lace persona, default model = current chat's model. This makes the UX much smoother - users can just click send to instantly create an agent, or customize as needed. Need to think about how to get "current chat's model" - probably from agent context or session context.
