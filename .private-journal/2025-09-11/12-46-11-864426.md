## Project Notes

Jesse wants to redesign the new agent creation flow in the web UI. Currently it's a modal from the session edit page, but he wants to add a + button to the session view sidebar that opens a chat-widget-like modal. The modal will let users pick a persona from the persona registry and a model (like the main UI's model selector below chat input). Need to understand the current implementation and design a new flow.
