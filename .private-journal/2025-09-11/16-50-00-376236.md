## Project Notes

Critical bug identified: Agent personas aren't being applied correctly. The system prompt defaults to the generic Lace prompt even when a specific persona is provided.

This is likely an issue in the agent initialization flow where the persona parameter isn't being properly used to load the correct system prompt. Need to trace:
1. API receives persona parameter ✓
2. spawnAgent gets persona parameter ✓  
3. Agent constructor/initialization uses persona ❓
4. System prompt generation from persona ❓

This is a core functionality bug that needs immediate investigation and fix.
