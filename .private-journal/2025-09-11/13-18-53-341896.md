## Project Notes

Jesse confirmed api.persona.catalog.ts for the naming. Now I have enough information to describe the complete design. The flow will be: + button in agents section header (like Tasks) -> opens chat-widget-style modal -> searchable dropdown for persona selection at top -> model selector at bottom -> optional message input -> send button creates agent and optionally sends first message.
