## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to do E2E debugging with browser automation and full logging to trace the persona bug. This approach will show:

1. UI sends correct data to API
2. API receives persona parameter correctly  
3. Agent creation gets persona
4. Prompt generation uses persona
5. Where the fallback prompt gets triggered

This systematic approach will identify the exact failure point rather than guessing. Good debugging methodology - use the actual user flow to find the issue.
