## Project Notes

I'm continuing to port Jason's component library systematically. I just read his comprehensive TimelineMessage component (308 lines) and TimelineView component. These are sophisticated components with full type definitions and detailed rendering logic for different message types (admin, human, AI, tool, integration, carousel). The components are well-structured and use proper TypeScript interfaces. 

Now I need to continue porting the TypingIndicator component that TimelineView depends on, and then move on to the chat input components. The architecture is clean and follows React best practices - each component has clear props interfaces and proper separation of concerns.

Key insights from the timeline components:
- TimelineMessage handles multiple message types with proper type discrimination
- Uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML for formatted content (code blocks, inline code)  
- Integrates with FontAwesome icons properly
- Has proper agent-specific styling (Claude orange, GPT-4 green, Gemini blue)
- TimelineView handles auto-scrolling and streaming content display
- Both components follow the established pattern of proper TypeScript interfaces
