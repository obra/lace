## Project Notes

Found some issue with Next.js auto-creating tsconfig.json files. Looking at Jason's config from f/web to understand how to prevent this. The issue is that when Next.js detects TypeScript, it wants to create its own config, but we already have one at the root. Need to configure Next.js to respect our existing config structure and prevent creating conflicting configs in the web interface directory.
