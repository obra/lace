## Project Notes

# Web Interface Audit Findings

Completed comprehensive audit of f/web vs f/integrated-web-interface branches to ensure we rescued all of Jason's design work.

## Key Discovery: Missing Components Structure

f/web has a completely different structure than what we currently have:

### f/web Structure (Jason's work):
- `src/components/` (root level with extensive UI components)
- `src/app/` (Next.js app router structure)
- `src/hooks/` (custom React hooks)
- `src/lib/` (utilities including animations, fontawesome)
- `src/types/` (TypeScript type definitions)
- Extensive animated components and enhanced UI features

### Current f/integrated-web-interface:
- `src/interfaces/web/` (nested within interfaces)
- Basic components moved but missing many advanced features
- Missing entire categories of components

## Critical Missing Components from f/web:
- AnimatedLaceApp.tsx, AnimatedMobileSidebar.tsx, AnimatedSidebar.tsx
- All the Animated* variants of timeline components
- GoogleDocChatMessage.tsx
- TaskBoardModal.tsx
- Extensive UI components (AccountDropdown, Avatar, ThemeSelector, etc.)
- Advanced hooks (useChat.ts, useSSEStream.ts)
- Enhanced configuration (DaisyUI themes, FontAwesome setup)

## Dependencies Analysis:
f/web has significantly more UI-focused dependencies that we're missing:
- @headlessui/react
- @heroicons/react  
- @tanstack/react-query
- daisyui
- framer-motion (more extensive usage)
- Additional FontAwesome icon sets

This explains why Jason's designs are so much more sophisticated - we've only partially rescued the work.
