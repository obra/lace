## Project Notes

User corrected me - they don't want relative paths. Need to understand why the `~/interfaces/web` paths aren't working. Looking back at the error, it's a module resolution issue. The problem is likely that the webpack alias configuration in next.config.ts is mapping `~` to `./src` but Next.js is running from a different context or the paths aren't being resolved correctly. Need to check if the Next.js server is running from the right directory and if the webpack config is being applied properly.
