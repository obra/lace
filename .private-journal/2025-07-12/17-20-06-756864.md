## Project Notes

Working on porting Jason's web interface from f/web branch. Successfully fixed TypeScript compilation issues by:

1. Adding React imports to test files that were missing them
2. Replacing JSX fragment syntax `<>` with `React.Fragment` in components to fix jsxFragmentFactory issues
3. Fixing IntersectionObserver mock to include all required properties

The build now passes, but tests are revealing new issues:
- FontAwesome icons not properly mocked, causing TypingIndicator tests to fail
- Many existing CLI tests are now failing (47 failed suites), which is concerning
- PTY E2E tests timing out

Need to:
1. Fix FontAwesome mocking in test setup
2. Investigate why existing CLI tests are failing - this might be due to changes in dependencies or test configuration
3. Address the E2E test timeouts

The web interface porting is mostly complete from a code perspective, but the test failures suggest potential integration issues that need resolution.
