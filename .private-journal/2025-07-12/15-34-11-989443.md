## Project Notes

Jesse wants me to go back and write tests for the components I've already ported. He emphasized not overdoing it and not testing exact UX, but making sure components work. This is good guidance - I should focus on:

1. Components render without crashing
2. Props are handled correctly 
3. Basic functionality works
4. Key interactions work

I should avoid testing:
- Exact styling/CSS classes
- Pixel-perfect layouts
- Animation details
- Complex UX flows

I'll start with the timeline components since those are core to the chat interface.
