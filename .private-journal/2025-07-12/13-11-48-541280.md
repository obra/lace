## Project Notes

Lace web interface has TypeScript import problem with Next.js embedding. Current implementation uses CommonJS require() instead of ES module import, which bypasses type checking. The tsconfig.json uses "moduleResolution": "Node16" which is known to cause issues with Next.js imports.

Need to update web-interface.ts to use proper ES module imports and type the NextWrapperServer correctly. The Next.js type definitions are available at version 15.3.5 and provide comprehensive interfaces.
