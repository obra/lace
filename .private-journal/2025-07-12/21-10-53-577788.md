## Project Notes

Next.js still modified the tsconfig.json even though we tried to make it extend the root config. It's overriding our strict mode and other settings. This suggests that Next.js is being pretty aggressive about modifying the config regardless of what we set. The issue is that Next.js wants control over certain TypeScript settings that conflict with our project's strict configuration.

Need to find a way to prevent Next.js from modifying the tsconfig.json at all. Looking at the options:
1. Set typescript.ignoreBuildErrors to true - but that disables type checking entirely
2. Use a different approach where Next.js doesn't detect/modify TypeScript config
3. Accept that Next.js will modify it but ensure our settings are preserved

The real solution might be to configure Next.js to not auto-configure TypeScript, or to set up the config in a way that Next.js leaves it alone.
