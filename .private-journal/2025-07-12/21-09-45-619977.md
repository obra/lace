## Project Notes

Next.js keeps auto-creating tsconfig.json in the web interface directory even though we have one at the root. This happens when Next.js detects TypeScript files but doesn't find a tsconfig.json in its working directory (src/interfaces/web). Since Next.js runs from that directory, it thinks there's no TypeScript config and creates one. Need to either:
1. Tell Next.js to use the root tsconfig.json
2. Create a tsconfig.json in the web interface directory that extends the root one
3. Configure Next.js to not auto-create configs

Let me check what the recommended approach is.
