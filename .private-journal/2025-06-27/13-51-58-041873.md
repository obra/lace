## Project Notes

The tool types unification is revealing how deeply embedded the old format was throughout the codebase. Key patterns:
- ToolCallData had: toolName, input, callId
- ToolCall has: name, arguments, id
- ToolResultData had: callId, output, success, error
- ToolResult has: id, content, isError, metadata

The UI components will need careful updates since they display this data.
