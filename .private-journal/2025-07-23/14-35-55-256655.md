## Project Notes

Made great progress on Phase 1 cleanup. Successfully removed _currentThread cache, redundant methods, and _getActiveThreadId from Agent. Tasks 1-5 essentially complete. Still need to fix Session.getById() vestigial call, update test mocks, fix compact command, update comments, and verify with stateless tests. Build errors reduced from many to just session + test files - good systematic progress.
