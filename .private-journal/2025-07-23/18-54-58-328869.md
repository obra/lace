## Project Notes

The CodeBlock test failures were caused by missing @testing-library/jest-dom setup in test-setup.ts. Someone had removed it previously with a comment about "import issues in worktree" but this broke all DOM matcher assertions. Simply re-adding `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';` to test-setup.ts fixed all 24 tests. This suggests that whatever import issue existed in the worktree has been resolved, or we may need to monitor for any new issues this causes.
