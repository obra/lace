## Project Notes

Phase 2 Progress Update:
- Tasks 1-3 complete: Core types, event system updates, conversation builder logic
- Next up is Task 4: Write tests for conversation builder
- Then Tasks 5-14 involve ThreadManager integration, strategy implementation, full testing

Jesse is asking about when testing is supposed to happen. Looking at the plan:
- Task 4: Write tests for conversation builder (next)
- Task 7: Write tests for TrimToolResultsStrategy  
- Task 10: Write integration tests
- Task 13: Run full test suite
- Task 14: Manual testing

So testing is woven throughout - we test individual components as we build them, then do integration testing, then full suite testing. This follows TDD principles mentioned in the plan.
