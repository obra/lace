## Project Notes

Jesse addressed my concerns:

1. **Tool execution during compaction**: Jesse points out this is actually a FEATURE - files might have changed and agent context got polluted, so reloading them during compaction refreshes the context. That's exactly what you'd want.

2. **Storage bloat**: Jesse is not worried about this.

3. **Multiple compactions**: I need to explain what I'm actually worried about here.

I think my concern was about compaction accumulation and how strategies handle previous compactions, but Jesse's earlier point about strategy flexibility (they can choose their input scope) actually handles this naturally.
