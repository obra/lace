## Project Notes

Starting Phase 1 cleanup to remove vestigial shadow thread state management. This is a systematic cleanup following shadow thread removal - removing redundant _currentThread cache, unused methods, and simplifying to truly stateless ThreadManager. Plan looks solid with 12 incremental tasks, strong testing emphasis, and clear commit points.
