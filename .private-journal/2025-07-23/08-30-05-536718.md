## Project Notes

Jesse wants to see a more sophisticated compaction strategy example:
- Summarize all previous tool calls and agent thoughts into text
- Identify 5 most important files read during session
- Reload those files after compaction

This demonstrates how compaction events can handle:
- Content generation (summaries)
- Semantic analysis (file importance ranking)
- Active tool execution (file reloading)
- Complex state transformation

The compaction event would contain both the summary and the reloaded file contents, showing how this model can support much more sophisticated strategies than simple truncation.
