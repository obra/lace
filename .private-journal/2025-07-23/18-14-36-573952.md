## Project Notes

Jesse asked me to do Phase 2 Task 9, which is "Update ThreadManager to Auto-Register Strategies". Looking at the Phase 2 plan, this involves modifying the ThreadManager constructor to automatically register default strategies using the registry I just created. This will make the strategies available immediately without manual setup.
