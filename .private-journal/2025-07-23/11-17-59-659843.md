## Project Notes

This is a migration plan for moving task API endpoints from query parameter style to proper RESTful nested routes. Key points:

**Current problem**: 
- `GET /api/tasks?sessionId=xxx` 
- `GET /api/tasks/stream?sessionId=xxx`

**Target solution**:
- `GET /api/projects/[projectId]/sessions/[sessionId]/tasks`
- `GET /api/projects/[projectId]/sessions/[sessionId]/tasks/stream`

**Architecture context**:
- Event-sourcing with immutable conversation sequences
- Three-layer system: Data → Logic → Interface
- Task system provides shared coordination between humans and AI agents
- Session scoping for task isolation

**Key technical requirements**:
- TDD approach - write failing tests first
- Never use `any` types - use `unknown` with type guards
- No mocking of business logic in tests
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Frequent commits with descriptive messages

**Implementation phases**:
1. Preparation & Analysis (new API routes + tests)
2. React Integration Updates (hooks)
3. Component Updates (prop drilling)
4. Integration & Cleanup (remove old endpoints)
5. Performance & Production (verification)

The plan includes specific test structures, TypeScript patterns, and troubleshooting guides. Timeline estimate: 9-14 days total.
