## Project Notes

## Missing Test Coverage Analysis

Key areas I need to focus my QA review on:

1. **Database migration edge cases**: What happens to users with old shadow thread data?
2. **Thread loading with bad data**: How does the system handle threads that reference non-existent canonical IDs?
3. **Compaction behavior changes**: The new compact() method only truncates tool results vs creating shadow threads
4. **Agent threadId property**: Still claims to return "canonical" ID but canonical system is gone
5. **Test infrastructure cleanup**: Need to verify no test utilities assume shadow thread behavior
6. **UI/CLI impact**: Need to check if any interface components expect shadow thread functionality
7. **Performance implications**: Shadow threads had optimization benefits that are now gone
8. **Error handling**: Need to verify graceful degradation when shadow thread concepts are referenced

The fact that all tests pass is actually concerning - it suggests we might not have comprehensive enough tests for the removed functionality.
