## Project Notes

Completed Phase 1 shadow thread removal architectural review. Found mostly good work with clean removal of shadow thread complexity. The main areas that need attention are:

1. Documentation cleanup - several docs still reference shadow threads
2. Agent class still has comments about "canonical" thread IDs and compacted threads 
3. Test files and compaction system remain but seem intentionally preserved
4. Database schema properly cleaned up
5. ThreadManager properly simplified
6. Core functionality maintained

Key findings:
- Clean v10 database migration removes shadow thread tables
- All shadow thread methods properly removed from ThreadManager and DatabasePersistence
- Agent class still uses thread correctly but has outdated comments
- Tests are passing which indicates core functionality preserved
- Some intentional design decisions (keeping compaction system) that may be part of Phase 2

This was a well-executed refactoring that maintained system integrity while removing complexity.
