## Project Notes

Jesse's real requirements are more sophisticated than I initially understood:

1. **Full historical reconstruction** - need to be able to get back to pre-summarization state
2. **Experimental compaction strategies** - not just recency-based, might want semantic grouping, importance-based, etc.
3. **Strategy comparison** - presumably want to evaluate different approaches

This is less "conversation summarization" and more "conversation state management with multiple views". The current implementation's problems:
- Too much database overhead for what should be lightweight views
- Thread ID instability creates API complexity
- Shadow thread creation is too heavyweight for experimentation

Better approach might be:
- Canonical threads never change (stable IDs)
- Compaction "views" as metadata/transformations applied on read
- Pluggable strategies that can be applied/removed without data migration
- Event filtering/transformation system rather than physical thread copying
