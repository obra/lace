## Project Notes

Development workflow updated:
- Write tests for conversation builder (current)
- Run full test suite after each step
- Run linter after each step
- Going forward: TDD - failing tests before code implementation

This ensures we maintain code quality and follow proper TDD discipline throughout Phase 2 implementation.
