## Project Notes

Looking at the Phase 1 cleanup plan document:

**Status**: COMPLETE - all 9 core tasks done + additional cleanup
**What was accomplished**:
- Removed redundant _currentThread cache from ThreadManager
- Eliminated getCurrentThreadId(), setCurrentThread(), saveCurrentThread() methods  
- Removed _getActiveThreadId() from Agent class
- Fixed all test mocks and command references
- Added comprehensive stateless behavior tests
- Updated Session.getById() to remove vestigial calls

**Current test status**: 99.7% pass rate (1331/1334 tests passing)
**Known issues**: 3 failing tests (2 thread-compaction, 1 command integration - all pre-existing)

**Success criteria all met**:
✅ No instance state - ThreadManager has no _currentThread or related methods
✅ Single cache layer - Only sharedThreadCache remains  
✅ Clean Agent code - No redundant _getActiveThreadId() method
✅ All tests pass - Including new stateless behavior tests
✅ App works - Core functionality confirmed working

The document shows Task 8 (Update comments) was skipped as medium priority per user guidance. Everything else is done.

Looking for what's "left" - seems like everything is complete according to the documentation.
