## Project Notes

Looking at the current threads.md design doc, I can see it's heavily focused on the old shadow thread architecture with:

1. Thread versioning with canonical IDs and compacted versions
2. Version history tables and version management
3. `SummarizeStrategy` that creates new thread versions
4. Complex dual-ID system with canonical vs version IDs
5. Database schema with version mapping tables

This is exactly the complexity that Jesse wanted to remove. I need to update this to reflect the new clean design where:

1. No thread versioning or shadow threads - threads keep same ID always
2. Compaction via COMPACTION events stored in same thread
3. Simple strategy pattern with CompactionEvent data structure
4. Clean database schema without version tables
5. Single thread ID system, no canonical mapping

The new design is much simpler and more maintainable.
