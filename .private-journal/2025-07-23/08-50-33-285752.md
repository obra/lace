## Project Notes

Jesse caught me being inconsistent. I originally said the working conversation would be:
`compactedEvents + events after compaction`

But then I started talking about preserving original USER/AGENT messages "outside compaction" which contradicts that design.

The original design was cleaner: compactedEvents completely replace everything before the compaction point. If a strategy wants to preserve user messages, it includes them in compactedEvents. If not, they're gone from the working conversation (but preserved in database for reconstruction).

Need to stick with the original replacement-based design.
