## Project Notes

Looking at current Phase 2 implementation files. I can see there's inconsistency between what I documented and what's already been implemented:

1. The test file shows CompactionEvent using top-level strategyId, originalEventCount (lines 81-82, 100-101)
2. The strategy implementation shows data structure correctly in data field (lines 38-47)
3. The types file shows correct CompactionEvent extending ThreadEvent with data: CompactionData

The tests are inconsistent with the documented approach. They have mixed structure - some events have data in data field, others have strategyId/originalEventCount at top level. This suggests the implementation wasn't fully aligned with the user's decision.

Jesse asked me to finish updating the spec documentation, and I can see the current code has some inconsistencies that need to be addressed in the documentation.
