## Project Notes

Just completed addressing all reviewer feedback on the compaction system PR. All 4 tasks are done:

1. Type safety fixed by adding CompactionData to ThreadEvent union type and updating addEvent() signature
2. Performance optimized by changing findLastCompactionEventWithIndex to use single reverse pass instead of O(n) operations  
3. JSDoc documentation added to all public compaction methods
4. Union type properly updated to include CompactionData

The Phase 2 compaction system is fully implemented with:
- Event-based compaction using COMPACTION events (no more shadow threads)  
- CompactionData interface with strategyId, originalEventCount, compactedEvents, metadata
- buildWorkingConversation() and buildCompleteHistory() for conversation reconstruction
- TrimToolResultsStrategy implementation with comprehensive tests
- Strategy registry with auto-registration
- Thread ID stability maintained throughout compaction
- All integration tests passing with detailed event verification
- All reviewer concerns addressed with type safety, performance, and documentation improvements

The system correctly handles multiple compactions by using only the latest COMPACTION event, filters out old COMPACTION events from working conversations, and preserves complete history for debugging. Ready for final review and merge.
