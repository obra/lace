## Project Notes

Jesse is asking what the API should look like from the perspective of an experienced developer who doesn't know the codebase. They're right that:

1. "getWorkingEvents" is a bad name - not clear what it means
2. The compaction handling isn't obvious from the API
3. The relationship between different methods isn't clear

Need to think about what would be intuitive and self-documenting for someone coming to this fresh.
