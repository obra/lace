## Project Notes

I'm being asked to update the planning document as my last instruction. This is Phase 2 documentation for the compaction events system. I've successfully completed tasks 1-10, creating:

1. Core types for the compaction system 
2. Conversation builder logic that reconstructs working conversations after compaction
3. TrimToolResultsStrategy that truncates tool results to save tokens
4. Strategy registry for pluggable compaction approaches
5. Integration tests with detailed verification

The integration tests are passing and demonstrate:
- Basic compaction with tool result trimming
- Multiple compactions handling correctly
- Event ordering preservation
- Error handling for unknown strategies/threads

However, there are still lint errors:
- TypeScript error about 'args' property not existing in union type (line 29 in test)
- Two unsafe 'any' assignments from expect.stringContaining() usage

Based on the status in Phase 1 document, it shows Phase 1 is complete and ready for Phase 2. I need to update this to reflect Phase 2 progress - Tasks 1-10 completed, Tasks 11-14 pending.

The current state is that the core compaction system is working but has lint errors preventing commit. User wants me to update docs before fixing more issues.
