## Project Notes

**Phase 1 Shadow Thread Removal - QA Analysis Summary**

### What WAS Removed (Good)
Based on my examination, Phase 1 successfully removed:

1. **Database schema cleanup**: V10 migration removes shadow thread tables (thread_versions, version_history) 
2. **Code cleanup**: No calls to createShadow/getShadow/canonicalId methods remain
3. **Clean compaction**: Now uses simple tool result truncation instead of complex shadow threading
4. **API compatibility**: Thread APIs work with standard thread IDs, no shadow thread expectations

### Test Coverage Assessment
- All thread-related tests pass (39/39) - excellent sign
- Compaction tests work with new simplified approach
- Conversation building regression tests still pass
- API tests expect standard thread behavior

### Critical Edge Cases Found
✅ **Migration Handling**: V10 migration cleanly creates fresh schema, old shadow data simply ignored
✅ **Error Messages**: No references to removed shadow thread features in user-facing code
✅ **API Endpoints**: All checked endpoints use standard thread ID logic 
✅ **Command System**: /compact command works with new ThreadManager.compact() method

### Performance Analysis Still Needed
- Need to analyze if removed shadow thread optimizations cause performance regression
- Token counting may be less efficient without shadow thread caching
- Database queries might be different without canonical ID mappings
