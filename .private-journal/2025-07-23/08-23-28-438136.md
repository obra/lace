## Project Notes

Jesse clarified - this isn't research, it's production flexibility. Different chat types need different compaction strategies, and compacted views need to be persistent (become the new working state).

Key requirements:
- Persistent compacted views (not just read-time transformations)
- Multiple compaction strategies in production
- Ability to reconstruct pre-compaction state
- Extensible without architectural lock-in

Current problems with shadow threads:
- Thread ID instability creates confusion
- Dual-ID lookup system is expensive
- Database versioning is overly complex
- Shadow creation is too heavyweight

Might be better to think of compaction as "append compacted state to same thread" rather than "create new versioned thread". Keep canonical thread ID stable, but add compaction events that represent the new working state.
