## Project Notes

Jesse caught another naming problem - "original" doesn't make sense with multiple compactions. If you have multiple compaction events over time, what are the "original" events? Just the very first batch? The state before the most recent compaction?

The concept I was trying to capture was "events that aren't compaction artifacts" but that's probably not a useful distinction anyway. Maybe the API should just be:
- Current conversation state (what the agent sees)
- Complete timeline (everything for debugging/inspection)

The filtering of "compaction artifacts" might be unnecessary complexity.
