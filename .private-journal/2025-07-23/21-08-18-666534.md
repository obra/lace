## Project Notes

Jesse is asking me to update the planning doc with current state. This is the task UI integration plan we've been working from. I need to check what we've completed and what remains.

Looking at the todo list, we've completed:
- Task 1.1: TaskBoardModal configurability (all subtasks completed)
- Task 1.2: Tasks button integration (all subtasks completed)

So Phase 1 is complete. The next phase would be Phase 2: Sidebar Task List Implementation, but Jesse hasn't asked me to continue with that yet - just to update the planning doc with current progress.

I should read the planning doc and update it to reflect what we've accomplished.
