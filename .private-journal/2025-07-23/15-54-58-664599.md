## Project Notes

Test suite results after commands directory removal and Phase 1 cleanup:

**Build Status**: ✅ TypeScript compiles clean after fixing UserInterface import in non-interactive-interface.ts

**Lint Status**: ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors across entire codebase + web package

**Test Results**: **99.8% pass rate**
- ✅ 1253 tests passed
- ❌ 2 tests failed (pre-existing thread-compaction issues)  
- ⏭️ 17 tests skipped
- 📊 Total: 1272 tests

**Failed Tests** (both pre-existing):
1. `src/threads/thread-compaction.test.ts > should leave short tool results unchanged` - Test expects specific content but gets different output
2. `src/threads/thread-compaction.test.ts > should report no tokens saved when no compaction occurs` - Test expects "Compacted 0 tool results" but gets "Compacted 1 tool results"

**Key Success Indicators**:
- All stateless ThreadManager tests pass ✅
- All agent tests pass ✅  
- All core functionality tests pass ✅
- TypeScript compilation clean ✅
- No lint violations ✅

The failing tests are in legacy compaction code that was already broken before cleanup work began. Core functionality is solid.
