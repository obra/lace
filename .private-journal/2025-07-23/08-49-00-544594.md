## Project Notes

Jesse is asking a key design question about whether USER_MESSAGE and AGENT_MESSAGE events are included in the compactedEvents or preserved outside the compaction.

I was being inconsistent in my examples - sometimes showing user messages preserved in the original timeline, sometimes implying they'd be in compactedEvents.

Two approaches:
1. Preserve user/agent messages outside compaction (only compact tool interactions)
2. Include user/agent messages in compactedEvents (full conversation restructuring)

Need to think through which approach is better, or if strategies should be able to choose.
