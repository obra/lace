## Project Notes

Just read the Phase 1 shadow thread removal plan. This is a large refactoring task that involves removing a complex "shadow thread" system from the Lace AI codebase. The shadow thread system created compacted versions of conversations with dual ID lookups (canonical vs version IDs).

Key aspects of this task:
- 12 detailed subtasks with specific file locations and line numbers
- Complete removal of shadow thread complexity while preserving core functionality 
- Involves database schema changes, TypeScript interface cleanup, and test updates
- Well-documented with specific commit messages for each step
- Includes success criteria and troubleshooting guidance

The plan is very thorough and appears well-structured. Jesse has provided specific line numbers and code examples, which shows deep familiarity with the codebase. The task follows TDD principles and emphasizes frequent commits.

This seems like a good opportunity to demonstrate systematic refactoring skills while following Jesse's detailed technical guidance.
