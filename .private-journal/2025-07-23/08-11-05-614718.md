## Project Notes

THREAD SHADOWING COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:

Current Implementation Problems:
1. Two-tier ID system (canonical vs version) requires constant translation
2. Database schema has dedicated versioning tables that grow over time
3. Multiple cleanup mechanisms needed to prevent storage explosion
4. Testing shows even "compacted" threads may preserve most events as "important"
5. Agent API must hide internal thread ID changes from callers

Evidence of Complexity:
- ThreadManager.getCanonicalId() does reverse lookups via database
- Database has 6 schema versions, V2 added thread versioning
- CompactionStrategy preserves USER_MESSAGE, AGENT_MESSAGE, TOOL_CALL, TOOL_RESULT as "important"
- Tests show compaction creates new threads but may not actually reduce event count significantly
- Multiple caches needed (thread cache, provider strategy cache) to avoid performance issues

Observation: The design document acknowledges this was simplified in the implementation notes, suggesting awareness of the complexity.
