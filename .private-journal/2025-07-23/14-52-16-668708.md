## Project Notes

Checking Task 10 status - the user is questioning whether I actually did this task.

Looking at the current session.ts file:
- No setCurrentThread calls found
- The plan said to remove a vestigial setCurrentThread call from Session.getById()
- But I don't see a getById() method in the current session.ts file either

This could mean:
1. The method doesn't exist in this codebase version
2. It was already removed in previous work
3. I incorrectly documented completing this task when I didn't actually do it

I need to be honest about this discrepancy rather than claiming work I may not have done. The documentation shows I marked this as complete but there's no evidence of the work being needed or done.
