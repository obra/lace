## Project Notes

Jesse is proposing a two-phase approach:
1. Phase 1: Complete shadow thread removal + get non-compaction tests passing
2. Phase 2: Implement new compaction event system

This makes a lot of sense because:
- Clean separation of concerns (removal vs implementation)
- Easier debugging (know what broke and why)
- Incremental risk reduction
- Can verify core system works before adding new complexity

The system would temporarily have no compaction, but that's fine - regular conversations would still work. Then we add back compaction with the clean new system.

Much safer than trying to do removal + implementation simultaneously.
