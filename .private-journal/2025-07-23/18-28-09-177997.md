## Project Notes

Successfully fixed the useTaskManager.e2e.test.tsx validation and API route issues. The main problem was URL parsing logic that couldn't handle query parameters in API routes.

**Key Issues Fixed:**
1. **URL parsing with query parameters**: The mock fetch logic was splitting URLs on '/' but failing when query parameters like `?status=pending` were present. The URL parsing logic was trying to find exact matches for "tasks" but found "tasks?status=pending" instead.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified URL parsing to separate path from query parameters using `split('?')`
- Used the clean path (without query params) for route matching logic
- Changed all URL matching checks to use `urlPath` instead of `urlString`

**Code Changes:**
- Line 85: Added `const [urlPath, queryString] = urlString.split('?');`
- Lines 105, 114, 136, 144: Changed from `urlString.includes()` and `urlString.endsWith()` to `urlPath.includes()` and `urlPath.endsWith()`

**Testing Results:**
- All 4 tests in useTaskManager.e2e.test.tsx now pass
- Verified with multiple test runs for stability
- No regressions in other task-related API tests
- The session ID casting issue was already handled (line 66: `sessionId = session.id as string;`)

**Pattern Recognition:**
This follows the same type of fix pattern seen in task-api.e2e.test.ts where URL parsing and API route structure needed to be aligned. The fix maintains the RESTful nested route structure `/api/projects/[projectId]/sessions/[sessionId]/tasks` while properly handling query parameter filtering.
