## Project Notes

Phase 2 plan analysis:
- 14 well-defined tasks with clear deliverables
- Comprehensive test requirements for each component  
- Integration points identified: ThreadManager, Agent, conversation builder
- Simple starting strategy (TrimToolResultsStrategy) with clear behavior
- Event-based architecture fits naturally with existing event sourcing system
- No breaking changes to existing APIs - new methods added to ThreadManager

The plan addresses the token limit problem that shadow threads were trying to solve, but with a cleaner approach that doesn't require dual thread IDs or complex canonical mappings.

Ready to implement - the prerequisites are met (Phase 1 complete) and the tasks are concrete and testable.
