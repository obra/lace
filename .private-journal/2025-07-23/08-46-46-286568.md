## Project Notes

Jesse is thinking through my compaction event approach more carefully:

Positives they're seeing:
- Timestamps for ordering instead of synthetic IDs solves the ordering problem
- Compaction strategies can choose their input scope (from last compaction or from beginning)
- Gives strategies flexibility in how they handle incremental vs full compaction

Key concern: What does this look like when USER_MESSAGE and AGENT_MESSAGE are preserved across compactions? How does the conversation read to a human?

This is actually a good design discussion - Jesse is helping me think through the practical implications rather than just dismissing the approach. They seem open to it working but want to understand the edge cases and user experience implications.
