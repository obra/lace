## Project Notes

The /compact command revealed 4 main code quality issues in the web task API:

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling** - Stream route doesn't use createErrorResponse helper like other endpoints
2. **Missing Request Body Validation** - PATCH endpoint bypasses validation helper 
3. **Console.log Usage** - useTaskStream hook violates CLAUDE.md logging guidelines
4. **Type Safety Enhancement** - PATCH endpoint could use stronger typing

These are all technical debt items that should be addressed for consistency and maintainability. All the major functionality tests are now passing based on the todo list showing completed items.
