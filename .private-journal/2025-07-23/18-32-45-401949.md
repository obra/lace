## Project Notes

Successfully fixed all validation issues in the project route integration tests:

Files fixed:
- `/Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/lace/.worktrees/f-web-task-views/packages/web/app/api/projects/route.integration.test.ts` (4 failed tests -> all pass)
- `/Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/lace/.worktrees/f-web-task-views/packages/web/app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.integration.test.ts` (15 failed tests -> all pass)

Root cause was integration tests trying to create real Project/Session instances without proper environment setup. These classes trigger provider initialization which requires API keys.

The fix followed the same pattern as working tests: mock the env-loader to provide test API keys and use valid UUID format for project IDs instead of invalid strings like 'non-existent-id'.

Total test improvement: 19 failing tests -> 24 passing tests. All project API endpoints now have comprehensive integration test coverage.
