## Project Notes

Jesse asked me to provide a complete, actionable cleanup list of ALL shadow thread remnants that should be removed. I need to systematically go through the codebase and identify all references to shadow threads, compaction, canonical IDs, versioning, etc. that are related to the old shadow thread system.

From my examination, I can see:

1. **Documentation files** with extensive shadow thread references:
   - docs/design/terminology.md (lines 112-115, 114-115)
   - docs/design/multi-agent-architecture.md (line 143 onwards)
   - docs/plans/2025-07-23/ directory with multiple shadow thread plan files
   - CLAUDE.md has shadow thread references (lines 120, 207-211)

2. **Code remnants**:
   - src/threads/thread-manager.ts still has compaction strategy imports and usage
   - src/persistence/database.ts has a comment about "Clean schema without shadow thread complexity"
   - Several test files still reference compaction functionality
   - Entire src/threads/compaction/ directory still exists

3. **Comments and references** scattered throughout the codebase that mention shadow threads, compaction, canonical IDs, versioning

I need to create a comprehensive checklist that covers all these areas systematically.
