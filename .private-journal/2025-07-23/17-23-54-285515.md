## Project Notes

Jesse asked me to do Phase 2 Task 6, which based on the documentation is creating the TrimToolResultsStrategy. I can see from the Phase 2 plan that this involves creating a simple compaction strategy that truncates tool results to save token space. I've completed tasks 1-5 already, so now it's time to implement the actual strategy. Based on the TDD approach Jesse emphasized, I need to write failing tests first before implementing the strategy.
