## Project Notes

Jesse is asking a key architectural question about the compaction event model - what exactly are the `compactedEvents`? Are they:

1. Replacement events that represent the new synthetic conversation state (replacing original events)
2. Additional events that get added alongside original events

From my examples, I was assuming the replacement model where `compactedEvents` become the new working conversation state, replacing all original events up to the compaction point. This makes sense for token management since the whole point is to reduce the working conversation size.

Need to clarify this explicitly and show the conversation builder logic clearly.
