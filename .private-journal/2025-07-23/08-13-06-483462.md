## Project Notes

Jesse is experiencing pain with the thread shadowing implementation in the f/thread-shadowing branch. The system creates:

- Thread IDs that "change out from underneath" sessions (canonical vs version IDs)  
- Lots of thread versions with mostly identical content in the database
- Complex lookup tables to resolve thread IDs

The current implementation has:
- Two-tier ID system (canonical â†’ version mapping)
- Dedicated versioning tables (thread_versions, version_history)
- Complex transaction handling for shadow creation
- Multiple caching layers for performance
- Questionable effectiveness since most events are preserved as "important"

This is a classic over-engineering problem where the solution is more complex than the problem it solves. The compaction doesn't actually compact much (preserves user messages, agent messages, tool calls, tool results), but adds significant architectural complexity.

Need to suggest simpler alternatives that achieve the goals (continue conversations, preserve history) without the versioning nightmare.
