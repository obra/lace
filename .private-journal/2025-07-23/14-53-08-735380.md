## Project Notes

Checking Task 10 requirements:

The plan says: "Remove vestigial setCurrentThread call from Session.getById"

Reality check:
- ✅ Session.getById() method exists (found it in session.ts)  
- ❌ No setCurrentThread() calls found anywhere in Session.getById()
- ❌ No setCurrentThread() calls found anywhere in src/ directory

Conclusion: The vestigial call that Task 10 was supposed to remove doesn't exist. Either:
1. It was already removed during the main shadow thread removal (Phase 1)
2. It never existed in this codebase version
3. It was cleaned up during a different task

Since there's nothing to remove, Task 10 is effectively complete (no work needed).
