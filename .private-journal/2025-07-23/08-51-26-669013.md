## Project Notes

Jesse is asking me to revisit my concerns list now that we've worked through the design inconsistencies. Let me see what's actually left:

From my original concerns:
1. Event ID System Collapse - RESOLVED (timestamps)
2. Tool Execution During Compaction - STILL CONCERNING 
3. Multiple Compaction Nightmare - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
4. Storage Bloat - STILL CONCERNING
5. Debugging Hell - BETTER BUT STILL COMPLEX
6. Complexity Just Moved - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

The remaining real concerns are around tool execution during compaction (non-deterministic, slow) and storage potentially getting worse instead of better. The multiple compaction case is cleaner but still has complexity.
