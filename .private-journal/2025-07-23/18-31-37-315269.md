## Project Notes

Jesse asked me to do Phase 2 Task 10, which is "Write Integration Tests". Looking at the Phase 2 plan, this involves creating comprehensive integration tests that verify the full compaction workflow works end-to-end. This will test the interaction between ThreadManager, strategies, and conversation building to ensure everything works together properly.
