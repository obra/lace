## Project Notes

Jesse wants to understand how to implement their current compaction strategy (trimming tool call results) using the compaction event approach I suggested.

Current strategy appears to be:
- Keep USER_MESSAGE, AGENT_MESSAGE, TOOL_CALL events mostly intact
- Trim or modify TOOL_RESULT events to reduce token usage
- This creates a working conversation that has the same flow but reduced token count

In the compaction event model, this would mean:
- compactedEvents contains the modified event sequence
- TOOL_RESULT events in compactedEvents would have trimmed content
- Original TOOL_RESULT events remain in database for reconstruction
- Conversation builder uses compacted versions for ongoing conversation
