## Project Notes

The lint violations are clustered in these areas:
- Route handlers: unsafe `request.json()` assignments, unused imports
- Test files: unsafe assignments from API responses, improper error handling
- Stream route: extensive unsafe member access on event emitters
- Notes route: unsafe assignment and serialization issues

This is a systematic TypeScript strict mode compliance issue that requires methodical fixing, not band-aid solutions.
