╭ Great! Now I have a complete understanding of the system. Let me create the analysis and proposals.
│
│ ## Analysis & Proposals
│
│ Based on my examination of the codebase, here are my findings and recommendations:
│
│ ### 1. Safe Tool Approval System
│
│ Current Implementation:
│
│     * The approval system uses `ApprovalCallback` interface with `ApprovalDecision` enum
│     * CLI options support `autoApproveTools` array and `allowNonDestructiveTools` flag
│     * Tools can be marked with `readOnlyHint` annotation
│     * Global policy wrapper handles the decision flow
│
│ Proposed Enhancement:
│ Add a safeInternal annotation to tool definitions that bypasses all approval checks:
│
│     // In tool.ts
│     export interface ToolAnnotations {
│       readOnlyHint?: boolean;
│       safeInternal?: boolean;  // NEW: Always approved, never needs user consent
│     }
│
│     // In policy-wrapper.ts - add step 1.5:
│     // 1.5. Check if tool is marked as safe internal
│     if (cliOptions.allowSafeInternalTools !== false) {  // Default true
│       const tool = toolExecutor.getTool(toolName);
│       if (tool?.annotations?.safeInternal === true) {│         return ApprovalDecision.ALLOW_ONCE;
│       }
│     }
│
│ Implementation for Task Tools:
│ All task management tools would be marked as safeInternal: true since they're pure internal state management with no external
│ effects.
│
│ ### 2. Task Management Tool Renderers
│
│ Current System:
│
│     * Uses `TimelineEntry` component with status indicators
│     * Tool renderers follow naming convention: `TaskAddToolRenderer`, `TaskListToolRenderer`, etc.
│     * Generic renderer shows raw JSON input/output with `[GENERIC]` indicator
│
│ Proposed Designs:
│
│ #### A. Task Add Renderer (TaskAddToolRenderer)
│
│ Option 1: Minimal Success
│
│     ✓ task_add: "Test task management suite" → task_20250705_b9qers
│
│ Option 2: Detailed Success
│
│     ✓ task_add: Created task "Test task management suite"
│       → task_20250705_b9qers [high priority]

│
│       Blocked (1):
│         ⊗ task_20250705_xyz123 [low] Blocked dependency task
│
│ #### C. Task View Renderer (TaskViewToolRenderer)
│
│ Option 1: Card Layout
│
│     ✓ task_view: task_20250705_b9qers

│
│     ✓ task_complete: ✅ "Test task management suite" completed
│       🎉 Task finished in 2 minutes
│
│ ### 3. Design Principles for Task Renderers
>
│ Consistency:
│
│     * All use consistent status icons: ○ pending, ◐ in_progress, ✓ completed, ⊗ blocked
│     * Priority indicators: [high], [medium], [low] with color coding
│     * Timestamp formatting: consistent date/time display
│
│ Hierarchy:
│
│     * Primary action result (success/error) at top level
│     * Secondary details indented or as preview
│     * Expandable details for complex operations
│
│ Visual Elements:
│
│     * Use Unicode box-drawing characters for structure
│     * Color coding: green for success, red for errors, yellow for pending, blue for info
│     * Consistent spacing and alignment
│
│ Information Density:
│
│     * Collapsed: Essential info only (task ID, title, status)
│     * Expanded: Full details including notes, timestamps, assignments│     * Smart truncation with "..." indicators
│
│ ### 4. Recommended Implementation Approach
│
│     1. **Phase 1:** Add `safeInternal` annotation system
│     2. **Phase 2:** Implement task renderers with Option 1 designs (simpler)
│     3. **Phase 3:** Add expand/collapse functionality for detailed views
│     4. **Phase 4:** Consider Option 2 designs based on user feedback
│
│ The task management tools are perfect candidates for both improvements since they're completely internal, safe operations that
│ benefit greatly from clean, specialized rendering.

│ For the list,  the compact list
│ For the task view, clean list.  don't show the Created line.
│ For update: detailed, but don't show last modified
│ For note: show the note
│ For completion: simple success
