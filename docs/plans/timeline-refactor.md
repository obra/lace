# Timeline Architecture Refactor Plan

## Goal
Create a beautiful, simple timeline architecture where:
- Tool-specific rendering is dynamically discovered
- All timeline entries use consistent expansion behavior  
- Agent messages handle thinking blocks internally (no separate timeline items)
- User messages always show full content
- Less code is better code

## Current Problems
- Complex thinking block extraction creates multiple timeline items from single agent message
- Tool-specific rendering logic scattered throughout TimelineItem
- Multiple expansion state systems (delegationExpandState, toolExpandState)
- Inconsistent expandability and summarization across timeline entry types

## Target Architecture
```
AgentMessage (single timeline entry)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Collapsed: "Message content /thought for 150 words/"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Expanded: Full message including thinking blocks

UserMessage (single timeline entry)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Always full content (no collapse)

ToolExecution (single timeline entry)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dynamic renderer discovery (BashToolRenderer.tsx, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox for expansion

Single expansion state map for everything
```

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Simplify Agent Message Processing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Prompt**: "Remove thinking block extraction from ThreadProcessor and simplify agent message processing. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Remove `extractThinkingBlocks()` method from ThreadProcessor
- Change AGENT_MESSAGE case to create single timeline item with full content
- Remove thinking-related caching logic
- Remove THINKING event case (no longer needed)
- Update tests to expect single agent_message item instead of thinking + agent_message
- Keep raw content intact - let AgentMessageDisplay handle thinking internally

The AGENT_MESSAGE case should become:
```typescript
case 'AGENT_MESSAGE': {
  items.push({
    type: 'agent_message',
    content: event.data as string, // Full content with thinking blocks
    timestamp: event.timestamp,
    id: event.id,
  });
  break;
}
```

Remove all thinking-related timeline processing complexity."

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Enhance AgentMessageDisplay with Internal Thinking Handling ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Prompt**: "Refactor AgentMessageDisplay to handle thinking blocks internally with expansion. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Remove current thinking block stripping regex
- Parse thinking blocks internally: extract `<think>content</think>` sections
- When collapsed: Show message content + '/thought for X words/' markers where thinking blocks were
- When expanded: Show full message with thinking blocks rendered inline
- Use TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox for consistent expansion behavior
- Accept isExpanded and onExpandedChange props
- Default to collapsed state for messages with thinking blocks
- Count words in thinking blocks for the marker text

Collapsed example: 'I'll help you with that. /thought for 47 words/ Here's the solution...'
Expanded example: Show full markdown including thinking blocks with proper formatting

Remove dependency on separate ThinkingDisplay component."

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Update TimelineItem to Use Expansion for Agent Messages ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Prompt**: "Update TimelineItem to support expansion for agent_message type. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Add agent_message to expandable timeline entries
- Pass expansion props (isExpanded, onExpandedChange) to AgentMessageDisplay
- Use consistent expansion handling with other timeline entry types
- Generate unique item IDs for expansion state tracking
- Remove any remaining thinking-related logic from TimelineItem
- Update tests to cover agent message expansion behavior

Agent messages should now expand/collapse like tool executions and other entries."

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Ensure User Messages Always Show Full Content ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Prompt**: "Update user message rendering to always show full content without summarization. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- User messages should not use TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox
- Always render full user message content regardless of length
- Remove any truncation or summarization of user messages
- User messages should be immediately readable without expansion
- Update tests to verify full content display
- Keep MessageDisplay component but ensure it never truncates user content

User messages are typically short and represent user intent - they should always be fully visible."

---

## üöß PARTIALLY COMPLETED: Prop Drilling Elimination (Steps 8-9) üöß

We completed early elimination of prop drilling for delegation state:
- Removed delegateTimelines prop drilling from all timeline components  
- DelegationBox now accepts toolCall prop and extracts thread ID internally
- Removed extractDelegateThreadId prop drilling by making it internal utility
- All timeline components now manage their own state (expansion, delegation)
- Single expansion state approach established

This work aligns with Steps 8-9 goals and simplifies the remaining tool renderer work.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Create Generic Tool Renderer Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Completed**: Created GenericToolRenderer component with dynamic tool discovery system.

**What was implemented**:
- GenericToolRenderer component using TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox for consistent expansion
- Smart command extraction for bash, file operations, ripgrep, delegate tools
- Status indicators (‚úì success, ‚úó error, ‚è≥ pending) and streaming states
- JSON/text output detection with compact preview when collapsed
- Full input/output display when expanded with proper formatting
- Tool name formatting (file_read ‚Üí file-read) and parameter extraction
- getToolRenderer utility for dynamic component discovery with naming conventions
- Both async and React.lazy versions for different use cases
- 47 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality and edge cases

**Files created**:
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/GenericToolRenderer.tsx`
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/__tests__/GenericToolRenderer.test.tsx`
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/getToolRenderer.ts`
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/__tests__/getToolRenderer.test.ts`

**Architecture benefits**:
- Consistent expansion behavior for all tool executions
- Dynamic tool renderer discovery (bash ‚Üí BashToolRenderer.tsx)
- Easy extensibility by creating new component files
- Graceful fallback to GenericToolRenderer for unknown tools

---

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Create Dynamic Tool Component Discovery ‚úÖ COMPLETED  

**Completed**: Dynamic tool discovery utility was implemented as part of Step 5.

**What was implemented**:
- getToolRenderer function with naming convention mapping
- Graceful error handling for missing components  
- Both async and React.lazy versions for different use cases
- Comprehensive test coverage with 19 test cases
- Tool name to component name conversion (bash ‚Üí BashToolRenderer.tsx)
- Proper TypeScript types and linting compliance

This step was completed together with Step 5 as they were closely related.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Simplify TimelineItem Tool Execution Rendering ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Completed**: Refactored TimelineItem to use dynamic tool renderer discovery with self-managed component state.

**What was implemented**:
- Removed all tool-specific switch/case logic for tool_execution items
- Created DynamicToolRenderer component with async tool discovery
- Used getToolRenderer() to find specific components, fallback to GenericToolRenderer
- Removed expansion state props - components manage their own state
- Async component loading with loading state (shows GenericToolRenderer while loading)
- Updated all tests to match new simplified interface
- Preserved all existing tool functionality while simplifying architecture

**Key architectural decisions**:
- Components manage their own expansion state instead of prop drilling
- DynamicToolRenderer handles async loading and graceful fallback
- No delegate-specific logic in TimelineItem (will be handled by DelegateToolRenderer)
- Clean separation of concerns with unified tool rendering interface

**Files modified**:
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/TimelineItem.tsx`
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/__tests__/TimelineItem.test.tsx`

---

## ‚úÖ Step 8: Create Delegate Tool Renderer ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Completed**: Created comprehensive DelegateToolRenderer with specialized delegation functionality.

**What was implemented**:
- DelegateToolRenderer component using TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox for consistent expansion
- Delegate thread extraction logic moved from TimelineItem to DelegateToolRenderer
- Smart task extraction from input.task or input.prompt fields with fallback
- Thread ID extraction from output using pattern matching (Thread: delegate-thread-xxx)
- DelegationBox integration for full delegation timeline display when expanded
- Status indicators showing delegation progress and thread information
- Compact summary when collapsed: "delegate 'Task description'" with status
- Full delegation details when expanded: input, output, and delegation timeline
- Graceful handling when no delegate thread is found (no DelegationBox shown)
- JSON/text output detection for proper formatting
- 26 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality

**Files created**:
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/DelegateToolRenderer.tsx`
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/__tests__/DelegateToolRenderer.test.tsx`

**Verification**:
- Dynamic tool discovery successfully finds DelegateToolRenderer for 'delegate' tools
- Falls back to GenericToolRenderer for other tools as expected
- All tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- Clean separation of delegate-specific logic from generic timeline components

---

## Step 9: Fix Focus vs Selection Terminology

**Prompt**: "Rename all timeline cursor/selection variables to use correct terminology. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Rename `focusedItemIndex` ‚Üí `selectedItemIndex` throughout timeline components
- Rename `isFocused` props on timeline items ‚Üí `isSelected` 
- Rename `focusedLine` ‚Üí `selectedLine` or `cursorLine`
- Rename `itemToRefocusAfterMeasurement` ‚Üí `itemToReselectAfterMeasurement`
- Keep `useFocus({ id: 'timeline' })` for actual keyboard focus (correct as-is)
- Update all component interfaces and function signatures
- Update all tests to use correct terminology
- Update variable names in viewport hooks and timeline processors

**Terminology clarification**:
- **Focus**: Which component receives keyboard input (timeline, shell-input, etc.)
- **Selection**: Which item the cursor is highlighting within the focused timeline

This creates clearer separation between keyboard focus management and visual cursor selection."

---

## Step 10: Remove Keyboard Handling from TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox

**Prompt**: "Remove useInput from TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox to fix focus hierarchy issues. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Remove useInput hook entirely from TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox component
- Remove useCallback import (no longer needed)
- Keep component purely presentational - no keyboard handling
- Ensure TimelineViewport remains the single source of keyboard input
- Update any tests that expect TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox to handle keys directly
- Verify that expansion still works through proper hierarchy (TimelineViewport ‚Üí TimelineDisplay ‚Üí components)

**Problem being solved**: TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox was listening for keyboard input even when the timeline wasn't focused, causing expansion to work when it shouldn't (e.g., when shell-input is focused)."

---

## Step 11: Implement Event-Based Expansion Toggle

**Prompt**: "Add event-based communication for timeline expansion toggle. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Create useTimelineExpansionToggle hook for expandable components
- Use simple event emitter pattern (EventEmitter or custom events)
- Hook accepts isSelected boolean and toggleExpansion callback
- Only selected item responds to toggle events
- Update TimelineDisplay handleItemInteraction to emit toggle events on left/right arrows
- Update GenericToolRenderer and other expandable components to use the hook
- Test that only the selected item expands when left/right pressed
- Test that expansion doesn't work when timeline isn't focused

**Event flow**:
1. Timeline focused + item selected + left/right arrow pressed
2. TimelineDisplay emits 'toggle-expansion' event  
3. Only the selected expandable component responds and toggles its state

**Files to create**:
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/hooks/useTimelineExpansionToggle.ts`
- Corresponding test file"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 11.5: Fix DelegationBox Rendering (BLOCKED)

**Status**: BLOCKED - Requires tool types refactor first

**Issue**: DelegationBox cannot access delegate thread metadata due to type mismatch between ToolResult (rich content + metadata) and ToolResultData (flat string output). 

**Dependencies**: Complete `docs/plans/tool-types-refactor.md` first to enable:
- Delegate tool to include `metadata.threadId` in ToolResult
- DelegationBox to access thread ID directly without regex parsing  
- Full delegation timeline rendering

**Prompt**: "Fix DelegationBox to render delegate timelines properly after tool types refactor.

Requirements:
- Update DelegationBox to access `toolCall.result?.metadata?.threadId` directly
- Remove regex parsing logic for thread ID extraction
- Fetch actual timeline data from ThreadManager using threadId
- Replace placeholder timeline with real delegate thread events
- Test delegation rendering with actual delegate tool executions

This step can only be completed after the tool types refactor provides metadata access."

---

## ‚úÖ Step 12: Clean Up Removed Components and Dependencies ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Completed**: Successfully removed all unused thinking extraction components and dependencies.

**What was implemented**:
- Removed ThinkingDisplay component (no longer needed)
- Removed THINKING event type from timeline processor and type definitions
- Removed thinking case from TimelineItem switch statement
- Updated imports throughout codebase to remove thinking dependencies
- Cleaned up thinking-related comments and references
- Updated all test files to remove thinking-related assertions
- Verified no broken imports or unused code remains

**Files removed**:
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/ThinkingDisplay.tsx`

**Files modified**:
- `src/interfaces/thread-processor.ts` - Removed THINKING event processing
- `src/threads/types.ts` - Removed THINKING from EventType
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/TimelineItem.tsx` - Removed thinking case
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/EventDisplay.tsx` - Removed ThinkingDisplay import
- Multiple test files - Removed thinking-related test cases

**Preserved**:
- `thinking-parser.ts` utilities (still used by AgentMessageDisplay for internal processing)
- AgentMessageDisplay's internal thinking block handling

**Verification**:
- TypeScript compilation clean ‚úÖ
- 1252/1259 tests passing (99.4% - failures are external integration timeouts) ‚úÖ
- Core timeline functionality preserved ‚úÖ
- Thinking blocks still work internally in agent messages ‚úÖ

Timeline architecture is now clean of old thinking extraction complexity while preserving all functionality.

---

## Step 13: Add Specialized Tool Renderers (Optional)

**Prompt**: "Create specialized renderers for file operations and bash tools. Test-first approach.

Requirements:
- Create FileReadToolRenderer, FileWriteToolRenderer for file operations
- Create BashToolRenderer for bash command execution  
- Show file path or command in summary when collapsed
- Show file content or command output when expanded
- Use TimelineEntryCollapsibleBox consistently
- Add syntax highlighting for file content if feasible in terminal
- Test that dynamic discovery automatically finds these renderers

Files to create:
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/FileReadToolRenderer.tsx`
- `src/interfaces/terminal/components/events/tool-renderers/BashToolRenderer.tsx`
- Corresponding test files

Only implement if they provide clear value over GenericToolRenderer."

---
