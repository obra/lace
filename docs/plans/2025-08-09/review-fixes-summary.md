4. **Security**: Sensitive information is properly redacted
5. **UI/UX**: Clear visual distinction between errors, warnings, and success states

## Files Modified
- 50+ source files across both main and web packages
- Comprehensive updates to tool implementations
- UI component updates for status handling
- Test file updates for coverage

## Next Steps
1. Review the three discussion items in review-repair.md:
   - Regex vs literal search default in ripgrep
   - Status precedence for deduplication
   - UI treatment of 'aborted' status
2. Push changes and update PR
3. Wait for reviewer feedback
