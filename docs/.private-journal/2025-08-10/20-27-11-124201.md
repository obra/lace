## Project Notes

Lace event architecture issues:
- 4 incompatible event systems causing bugs
- Token usage bug: expects event.data.tokenUsage but it's at event.data.data.tokenUsage
- timeline-converter.ts is 344 lines with TODOs acknowledging the architectural debt
- Recommended approach: quick fix for immediate issue, then gradual migration to unified architecture
- This affects debugging, performance, and developer experience significantly
