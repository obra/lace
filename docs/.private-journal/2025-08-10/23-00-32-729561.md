## Project Notes

EventStreamManager migration status:
✅ Core changes complete:
- Updated broadcast() signature to accept ThreadEvent directly
- Removed StreamEvent wrapper logic
- Updated shouldSendToConnection to filter by threadId instead of scope
- Updated sendToConnection to work with ThreadEvent
- Removed deprecated task/agent event handlers
- Updated connection confirmation to use ThreadEvent

❌ Remaining work:
- ~60 files still calling broadcast() with old StreamEvent format
- Most are in session-service.ts (7 instances) and test files
- Need systematic conversion of all broadcast() calls

The core architecture change is sound - ThreadEvent is the right abstraction for conversation events, separate from task/project events.
