## Project Notes

Lace event migration status:
- Phase 1: ✅ Extended ThreadEvent types
- Phase 2: ✅ Updated all event producers (main code + tests)
- Phase 3: In progress - Need to delete StreamEvent
- Phase 4-8: Pending

The token usage bug should now be fixed with the unified event structure. The double nesting (data.data.tokenUsage) has been eliminated.
