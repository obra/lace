## Project Notes

Event architecture refactoring completed successfully. The session service now creates events in ThreadEvent format directly, eliminating the nested data.data structure that was causing confusion.

Key files modified:
- packages/web/lib/server/session-service.ts - Main refactoring of event creation
- src/agents/agent.ts - Updated _addEventAndEmit type signature  
- src/persistence/database.ts - Added transient event type cases for exhaustive checking
- packages/web/hooks/useAgentTokenUsage.ts - Fixed to work with flattened structure

The build now compiles cleanly and the event system has a consistent ThreadEvent format throughout. Transient events are properly handled and won't be persisted to database as intended.
