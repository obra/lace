## Project Notes

Jesse caught an important gap - I only completed Phase 1 & 2 for the main src/ codebase but completely missed packages/web. Looking at the directory structure, packages/web has extensive test coverage including:

1. __tests__/ directories throughout the API routes (app/api/**/__tests__/)
2. Component tests (components/__tests__/)  
3. Hook tests (hooks/__tests__/)
4. Server utility tests (lib/server/__tests__/)
5. Integration and E2E tests

From the mock inventory I created, I identified several problematic areas in packages/web:
- API route tests that mock entire backend services (@/lib/server/session-service)
- Tests that mock business logic instead of testing real HTTP behavior
- Problematic mocks in API routes for projects, tasks, sessions

I need to:
1. Apply Phase 1 (colocated test pattern) to packages/web - move __tests__/ dirs to colocated
2. Apply Phase 2 (document essential mocks) to packages/web test files
3. Update the mock inventory if I find additional issues

This is a significant oversight since packages/web appears to have as many or more problematic mocks as the main codebase.
