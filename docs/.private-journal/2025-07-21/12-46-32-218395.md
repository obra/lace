## Project Notes

Analyzing Phase 3 of test remediation plan. Need to count parallel subtasks for core logic de-mocking. From mock inventory and test plan:

**Core Issues to Fix:**
1. Service Layer Tests (3 high-priority files)
2. Agent Tests (1 file but complex)
3. Tool Tests (multiple tool files)
4. API Route Tests (web package - multiple files)
5. Hook Tests (web package)
6. UI Component Tests (src/ terminal components)
7. Session/Project Integration Tests

**Parallel Subtasks Identified:**
- Task 3.1: Service Layer (SessionService, core business logic)
- Task 3.2: Agent System (agent.test.ts)
- Task 3.3: Tool System (all tool tests)
- Task 3.4: API Routes (web package routes)  
- Task 3.5: UI Components (terminal renderers)
- Task 3.6: Integration Tests (session/project)

Each can be done independently since they test different layers. The key is ensuring no shared dependencies between the parallel work.
