## Task 7: Integration and Testing (VALIDATION)
**Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION - All foundation components completed, ready for final integration
**Prompt:** "Integrate all enhancements and create comprehensive tests. Update `src/tools/tool-registry.js` to include the new TaskTool. Write tests that demonstrate:
- An agent using TaskTool to spawn multiple sub-agents working in parallel
- Parallel tool execution with mixed success/failure scenarios  
- Progress reporting from complex multi-step tasks with sub-agents
- Inter-agent message passing for coordination
- Error recovery when parallel operations fail
- Performance comparison between sequential vs parallel tool execution

Use Jest testing framework for all tests."

**Prerequisites Completed:**
- âœ… TaskTool foundation with delegateTask(), spawnAgent(), reportProgress(), requestHelp()
- âœ… ProgressTracker for lightweight progress aggregation without conversation pollution
- âœ… Parallel tool execution with Promise.all() and Semaphore-based concurrency control
- âœ… Enhanced tool result synthesis with batch processing and relationship detection
- âœ… Inter-agent message passing with sendMessage()/receiveMessages() and relationship tracking
- âœ… Error recovery with retry logic, circuit breaker pattern, and fallback strategies
- âœ… Jest testing framework configured with ES module support
- âœ… 33 comprehensive unit tests across all components (18 inter-agent + 15 error recovery)

## Implementation Notes:
- **No backward compatibility required** - can break existing workflows for better architecture
- Orchestration enabled by default with maxConcurrentTools = 10
- Progress updates should be lightweight (< 50 tokens each)  
- Sub-agents should return concise summaries, not full tool outputs
- The system should gracefully degrade if parallel execution isn't beneficial
- Configuration via CLI options (--max-concurrent-tools, etc.)
- Each task should maintain the existing context isolation principles
