# Agent Tool Orchestration Enhancement Spec

## Implementation Order (Optimized by Dependencies)

### Foundation Layer
**Task 2** → **Task 3**: TaskTool needs ProgressTracker as dependency
### Core Enhancement  
**Task 1**: Parallel execution (main architectural change)
### Feature Enhancements
**Task 4** → **Task 5** → **Task 6**: Build on parallel execution foundation
### Validation
**Task 7**: Integration testing after all features complete

## Task 2: Create TaskTool for Agent Orchestration (FOUNDATION)
**Prompt:** "Create a new `TaskTool` class in `src/tools/task-tool.js` that wraps the existing agent spawning capabilities. Implement these methods:
- `delegateTask(description, options)` - Spawn a sub-agent to handle a task, with optional role/model specification
- `spawnAgent(role, model, capabilities, task)` - Create a specialized sub-agent for complex workflows  
- `reportProgress(status, progressPercent, details)` - Send lightweight progress updates (store in agent state, don't pollute context)
- `requestHelp(errorDescription, attemptedSolutions, helpNeeded)` - Signal that the agent needs assistance

The tool should use the existing `spawnSubagent()` and `delegateTask()` methods from the Agent class. Add proper error handling and timeout management."

## Task 3: Add Progress Tracking System (FOUNDATION)
**Prompt:** "Implement a lightweight progress tracking system that doesn't pollute the coordinator's context. Create a `ProgressTracker` class that:
- Stores progress updates from sub-agents in memory (not in conversation history)
- Aggregates progress from multiple parallel sub-agents 
- Provides a `getProgressSummary()` method that returns concise status updates
- Automatically cleans up completed/failed agent progress data
- Supports progress callbacks to the user interface layer for real-time updates

Integrate this with the TaskTool's `reportProgress()` method."

## Task 1: Implement Parallel Tool Execution in Agent Core (CORE ENHANCEMENT)
**Prompt:** "Modify the agent's tool execution loop in `src/agents/agent.js` lines 188-210 to support parallel execution. Replace the sequential `for` loop with `Promise.all()` to execute all tool calls concurrently. Handle partial failures gracefully - if some tools succeed and others fail, collect all results and continue. Add a `maxConcurrentTools` configuration option (default: 10) to prevent overwhelming the system. Ensure tool approval still works correctly for each parallel tool call. Update the tool result formatting to handle parallel execution results. Orchestration is enabled by default."

## Task 4: Enhance Tool Result Synthesis (FEATURE ENHANCEMENT)
**Prompt:** "Improve the existing tool result synthesis system in `src/agents/agent.js` (lines 433-483) to work with parallel tool execution. When multiple tools return large results simultaneously, the synthesis agent should:
- Process multiple tool results in a single synthesis pass
- Identify relationships and dependencies between parallel tool results
- Create a unified summary that preserves essential information from all tools
- Use a more sophisticated token estimation (current rough estimate at line 435 is too simplistic)
- Add configuration for synthesis thresholds per tool type (some tools may need different limits)"

## Task 5: Add Inter-Agent Communication (FEATURE ENHANCEMENT)
**Prompt:** "Implement a simple message passing system for coordinating between sub-agents without going through the coordinator. Create:
- `sendMessage(recipientId, messageType, content, priority)` method in TaskTool
- `receiveMessages()` method to check for incoming messages
- Message routing that can deliver messages between parent/child agents and sibling agents
- Message types: 'status_update', 'request_help', 'share_result', 'coordination'
- In-memory message queue with automatic cleanup of old messages
- Integration with the existing agent spawning system to track agent relationships"

## Task 6: Error Recovery and Retry Logic (FEATURE ENHANCEMENT)
**Prompt:** "Add robust error handling to the parallel tool execution system. Implement:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient tool failures
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when multiple tools fail
- Fallback strategies - if parallel execution fails, retry sequentially
- Error aggregation that can distinguish between tool-specific errors vs systemic issues
- Graceful degradation - continue with successful tools even if some fail
- Error reporting that provides actionable information to the agent for recovery"

## Task 7: Integration and Testing (VALIDATION)
**Prompt:** "Integrate all enhancements and create comprehensive tests. Update `src/tools/tool-registry.js` to include the new TaskTool. Write tests that demonstrate:
- An agent using TaskTool to spawn multiple sub-agents working in parallel
- Parallel tool execution with mixed success/failure scenarios  
- Progress reporting from complex multi-step tasks with sub-agents
- Inter-agent message passing for coordination
- Error recovery when parallel operations fail
- Performance comparison between sequential vs parallel tool execution

Use Jest testing framework for all tests."

## Implementation Notes:
- **No backward compatibility required** - can break existing workflows for better architecture
- Orchestration enabled by default with maxConcurrentTools = 10
- Progress updates should be lightweight (< 50 tokens each)  
- Sub-agents should return concise summaries, not full tool outputs
- The system should gracefully degrade if parallel execution isn't beneficial
- Configuration via CLI options (--max-concurrent-tools, etc.)
- Each task should maintain the existing context isolation principles
