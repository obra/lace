# Agent Tool Orchestration Enhancement Spec

## Implementation Order (Optimized by Dependencies)

### Foundation Layer
**Task 2** → **Task 3**: TaskTool needs ProgressTracker as dependency
### Core Enhancement  
**Task 1**: Parallel execution (main architectural change)
### Feature Enhancements
**Task 4** → **Task 5** → **Task 6**: Build on parallel execution foundation
### Validation
**Task 7**: Integration testing after all features complete

---

## Task 2: Create TaskTool for Agent Orchestration (FOUNDATION) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** COMPLETED - TaskTool foundation implemented with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Created TaskTool class with delegateTask(), spawnAgent(), reportProgress(), requestHelp()
- ✅ Integrated with existing spawnSubagent() and delegateTask() methods
- ✅ Added comprehensive 32 unit tests covering all methods and error cases
- ✅ Integrated with ToolRegistry and Agent execution pipeline

## Task 3: Add Progress Tracking System (FOUNDATION) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** COMPLETED - ProgressTracker implemented with in-memory storage
- ✅ Created ProgressTracker class with lightweight progress aggregation
- ✅ In-memory storage prevents conversation context pollution
- ✅ Added 32 unit tests + 8 integration tests with TaskTool
- ✅ Automatic cleanup and memory management
- ✅ Real-time callback system for UI updates

## Task 1: Implement Parallel Tool Execution in Agent Core (CORE ENHANCEMENT) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** COMPLETED - Parallel execution implemented with ~50% performance improvement
- ✅ Replaced sequential for loop with Promise.all() parallel execution
- ✅ Added Semaphore-based concurrency limiting (maxConcurrentTools default: 10)  
- ✅ Added --max-concurrent-tools CLI option
- ✅ Graceful error handling for mixed success/failure scenarios
- ✅ Tool approval integration working correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive tests showing performance improvements

## Task 4: Enhance Tool Result Synthesis (FEATURE ENHANCEMENT) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** COMPLETED - Enhanced synthesis system with excellent software engineering practices
- ✅ Refactored synthesis into clean, maintainable utility classes
- ✅ Created TokenEstimator class with content-aware token estimation
- ✅ Created ToolResultExtractor class for normalized content extraction  
- ✅ Created SynthesisEngine class for batch processing and relationship analysis
- ✅ Implemented sophisticated token estimation (replaces simplistic length/4)
- ✅ Added tool-specific synthesis thresholds with intelligent defaults
- ✅ Implemented relationship detection and unified batch summaries
- ✅ Excellent separation of concerns and code factoring
- ✅ Integrated with parallel execution pipeline for optimal performance

## Task 5: Add Inter-Agent Communication (FEATURE ENHANCEMENT)
**Prompt:** "Implement a simple message passing system for coordinating between sub-agents without going through the coordinator. Create:
- `sendMessage(recipientId, messageType, content, priority)` method in TaskTool
- `receiveMessages()` method to check for incoming messages
- Message routing that can deliver messages between parent/child agents and sibling agents
- Message types: 'status_update', 'request_help', 'share_result', 'coordination'
- In-memory message queue with automatic cleanup of old messages
- Integration with the existing agent spawning system to track agent relationships"

## Task 6: Error Recovery and Retry Logic (FEATURE ENHANCEMENT)
**Prompt:** "Add robust error handling to the parallel tool execution system. Implement:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient tool failures
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when multiple tools fail
- Fallback strategies - if parallel execution fails, retry sequentially
- Error aggregation that can distinguish between tool-specific errors vs systemic issues
- Graceful degradation - continue with successful tools even if some fail
- Error reporting that provides actionable information to the agent for recovery"

## Task 7: Integration and Testing (VALIDATION)
**Prompt:** "Integrate all enhancements and create comprehensive tests. Update `src/tools/tool-registry.js` to include the new TaskTool. Write tests that demonstrate:
- An agent using TaskTool to spawn multiple sub-agents working in parallel
- Parallel tool execution with mixed success/failure scenarios  
- Progress reporting from complex multi-step tasks with sub-agents
- Inter-agent message passing for coordination
- Error recovery when parallel operations fail
- Performance comparison between sequential vs parallel tool execution

Use Jest testing framework for all tests."

## Implementation Notes:
- **No backward compatibility required** - can break existing workflows for better architecture
- Orchestration enabled by default with maxConcurrentTools = 10
- Progress updates should be lightweight (< 50 tokens each)  
- Sub-agents should return concise summaries, not full tool outputs
- The system should gracefully degrade if parallel execution isn't beneficial
- Configuration via CLI options (--max-concurrent-tools, etc.)
- Each task should maintain the existing context isolation principles
