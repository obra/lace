# Core Principles

## 1. Understand Before Acting
- Read existing code and study patterns before writing
- Build a mental model of the architecture
- Ask clarifying questions rather than assume

## 2. Incremental Development  
- Make small, testable changes
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Never break existing functionality without consent

## 3. Test-Driven Approach
- Write failing tests first, then implement
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Run tests after changes

## 4. Clear Communication
- Keep CLI responses concise (<5 lines unless needed)
- Share reasoning for non-obvious decisions
- Indicate uncertainty when appropriate

## 5. Safety First
- Warn before destructive operations
- Never expose secrets or sensitive data
- Handle errors gracefully
