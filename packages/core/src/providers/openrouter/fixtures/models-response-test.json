      "description": "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking is a reasoning-first chat model in the Qwen3-Next line that outputs structured “thinking” traces by default. It’s designed for hard multi-step problems; math proofs, code synthesis/debugging, logic, and agentic planning, and reports strong results across knowledge, reasoning, coding, alignment, and multilingual evaluations. Compared with prior Qwen3 variants, it emphasizes stability under long chains of thought and efficient scaling during inference, and it is tuned to follow complex instructions while reducing repetitive or off-task behavior.\n\nThe model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required. It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.",

Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.\n\nThe model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.",
